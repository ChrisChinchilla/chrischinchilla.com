The Enthusiastic Amateur is a new show with two different, but connected motivations. The first is to highlight people working enthusiastically on a subject in their spare time. The second is for those of you enthusiastic about a topic yourselves, and to give you what you need to know to get started.

If you fit into one of these categories, and want to share your enthusiasm, I want to hear from you. This is not a show for sales pitches, or marketing hype, this is a show for people doing what they love who want to tell the world about their passion.
