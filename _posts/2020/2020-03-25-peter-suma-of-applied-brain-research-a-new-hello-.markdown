In this episode I speak with Peter Suma of Applied Brain Research about Nengo, a complete _brain maker that_ allows you to develop and run models with deep learning, online learning, static weights, simple linear neurons, complex spiking neurons, and everything in-between.  
  
Also features content covering tools for working from home, two player games, a "Hello World" for the modern era, and much more!
