I'm taking a short break, so something from the archives this week of my ill-fated podcast from last year, "The Enthusiastic Amateur". This interview is reproduced in entirety to get the listeners it deserved. A great interview with Sinclair Target of [two-bit history](https://twobithistory.org) about the hidden stories from computing history.
