In this episode I speak with Paolo Negri about their API-first content platform. Also features the story of Bullfrog, history books for roleplayers, judging an open source project, and more.

Watch my DXpose livestream where I judge the developer experience of Contentful [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/735089138).
