Inspired by the magnificent Owlbear, winners of the @Jamesintrocaso Twitter tournament, we're playing The Phantasmal Owlbear's Den written by Tomas Gimenez Riojas. This along with other encounters and resources for your table can be found at Tribality.com. Special thanks to our players; Fotis, Chris, Patrick, and Tuz, and our DM Peter. Art and maps by Sean Evans, Gogots, and the video game Dragon's Crown.
