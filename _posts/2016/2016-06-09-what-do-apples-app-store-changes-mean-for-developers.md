It's a sobering time to be a mobile developer, with both app and device sales down. Personally, I feel this is just the maturation of a new(ish) industry, and everything will work out eventually. But, noticing major dents in their revenue, the major players are clearly worried.

Google ostensibly announced their new app strategy recently at IO with 'Instant Apps'. This is a way of creating and packaging apps that doesn't require users to visit an app store. It's an interesting idea, but it's still unclear how developers (and Google) will monetize their efforts.
