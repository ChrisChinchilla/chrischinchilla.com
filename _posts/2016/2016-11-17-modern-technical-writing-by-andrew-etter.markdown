                Recently, Andrew Etter published Modern Technical Writing: An Introduction to Software Documentation. The book presents an argument for writing in lightweight markup, storing it in distributed version control, and using static site generators. This talk features a short summary of an already short book, lessons learned during the Kindle publishing process, and the additions and changes Andrew would make to a hypothetical second edition.
