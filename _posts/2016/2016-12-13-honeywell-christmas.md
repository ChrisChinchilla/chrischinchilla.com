The USPS expects to deliver 750 million packages this holiday season — that’s 5 million packages a day. This is a 12% increase from 670 million in the 2015 holiday season. In response, U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is deploying more than 5,000 additional Honeywell mobile devices as part of its expanded parcel tracking network. In addition to various permanent locations, the technology will be deployed at 58 temporary facilities being used to accommodate holiday shipments.
