As a (very) frequent writer and editor I often find myself writing and correcting the same words over and over again. Or in preparation for publishing I have to repeatedly undertake the same steps, such as adding short codes or formatting links.

In most cases these tasks are actually a series of search and replaces, so I wondered how these could be incorporated into an Atom plugin to be triggered with one command.

The plugin turned out more complex than I initially thought and is still in development, but you can find more details on the [Atom package page](https://atom.io/packages/editors-friend) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/Editors-Friend).
