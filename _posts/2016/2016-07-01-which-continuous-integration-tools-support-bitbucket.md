Automate your tools with Bitbucket

Automating our development and deployment processes can save lots of valuable time, especially when the tasks are fairly repetitive. Using continuous integration tools such as Bamboo, Jenkins, and Code Ship with Bitbucket repositories can save time, and ultimately, money.
