This has been a week of me appearing at meetups rather than attending, and I must admit, when I present, I tend to forget what else happened. More of an adrenaline rush than egotism. I hope.

I delivered an Ignite talk about technology in board games, which went well, but I think the Ignite format lends itself more to 'inspirational' style talks. I also appeared on a panel recapping new products from IFA, and added sufficient journalistic realism. I think.

Aside from that I had a more relaxed week, spending evenings at home, playing D&D and saving my energy and money for this weeks Write the Docs conference.

This means I have no main discussion topic in this post, but instead, more links that have interested me throughout the week.

# Links of the Week

[Why Silicon Valley is all wrong about Apple's AirPods](https://medium.com/chris-messina/silicon-valley-is-all-wrong-about-the-airpods-8204ede08f0f) delves deeper into my thoughts last week, pointing out some more crucial moments in Apple history that shows they have been far less of a computer company since the early 00s.

I found ['Dreadnoughts of the trenches': ​100 years since tanks first appeared on the battlefield](https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2016/sep/15/first-world-war-tanks-1916) interesting as the early 20th Century really was a watershed moment in where old technology met new, and the emergence of tanks and Airplanes is a moment that highlights that.

I worry about the next decade in Europe, and this article on [Miloš Zeman: the hardline Czech leader fanning hostility to refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees) covers the attitudes of a leader I had not heard of, but adds to that worry.

I have covered some aspects of Blockchain technology, but only touched lightly on its usage in governance. [I Became a Citizen of Bitnation, a Blockchain-Powered Virtual Nation. Now What?](https://motherboard.vice.com/read/bitnation-or-bust) added topics to an already forming article idea in my mind.

As a dual British citizen I am often fascinated by how much of its own history it successfully avoids. [Britain's secret wars](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/britains-secret-wars-oman) added more ammunition (excuse the pun) to this.
