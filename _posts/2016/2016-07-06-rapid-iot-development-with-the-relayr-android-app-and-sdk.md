relayr is an IoT platform as a service, aiming to help IoT developers centralize and aggregate the data generated by IoT connected devices. By installing their hardware and software SDKs you don't need to worry about specific SDKs and data types generated by various devices, but instead code against the relayr APIs.

relayr began with the Wunderbar, a custom IoT prototyping tool that provides a multitude of sensors and adapters. In May, the company released the Proto IoT Android app and I met with two of their team (Bernard and Marcos) here in Berlin to discuss why they created the app and what developers can do with it.
