After making many changes, some of which I will get around to blogging about soon, play testing for Chip Shop is open again!

If you're not already signed up to the testing newsletter, [then join here](https://gregariousmammal.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a177a7811dd28fcd87829f78f&id=13bd96907c), but this isn't compulsory, it will just keep you up to date.

## Manual
You can access the game manual as [HTML](https://chipshopgame.com/manual/) and [PDF](https://chipshopgame.com/pod/Individual%20pdfs/manual/manual.pdf).

## Print Yourself
You can download PDFs of all the game assets to print yourself, cut out and play.

If you open [this URL](https://chipshopgame.com/pod/), you should find everything you need, split into respective decks, player mats (print one for each player) and the main board (two A4 sheets). You will need some generic tokens and counters for tracking scores, resources etc...

## Tabletop Simulators
I am working hard to get the game 'officially' into several Tabletop Simulators, but for now you can access all the game assets as PNGs and add them yourself. I have only tested this on Tabletop Simulator.

If you open [this URL](https://chipshopgame.com/simulators/tabletop_simulator/), you should find everything you need, split into respective decks (for separate upload), player mats (upload one for each player) and the main board (one A3 sheets). You will need some generic tokens and counters for tracking scores, resources etc...

## Feedback
I want your feedback, here's how you can give it:
