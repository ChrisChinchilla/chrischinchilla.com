Docker is currently one of the most spoken about tech projects right now and it's hard to believe that it's only two years old. As part of the celebrations, the Docker team decided to host more than a dozen open-source-a-thon parties around the World. Not only to help people learn how to contribute to the project, but also donating $50 for every contribution to the Oceanic Society.

In our first blog post as part of the celebrations, we attended the party in Berlin. The event was held at Soundcloud's main office in its vast Kitchen area. We took a crate of cakes along to accompany the pizza and drinks which were greatly appreciated as hacker fuel.
