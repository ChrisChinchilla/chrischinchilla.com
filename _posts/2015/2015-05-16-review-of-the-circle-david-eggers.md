I have been wanting to read this as part of my research into dystopian fiction for my One day the World Ended project and I have mixed opinions on this book.

I loved the concept and it's scarily close. Whilst reading some of the book I was in NYC and it seemed even closer to reality.

However, the pacing of the book was odd, it had a lot of padding and then the 'dramatic conclusion' is about twenty pages. Some of the writing is a bit trashy to, comparisons to Brave New World are not deserved. It also felt like the dystopian future wasn't really that bad, maybe that was the point.

In conclusion, worth reading, but not as great or as sinister as I hoped. [Want to earn me a few cents?
