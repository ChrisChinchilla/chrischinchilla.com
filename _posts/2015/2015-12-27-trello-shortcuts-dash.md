I have loved Kapeli's offline documentation browser, [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) for a while now and have been intending to start contributing to it for the best part of 2015.

You can find my first of many contributions in the form of a cheatsheet for Trello's keyboard shortcuts.

Simply search for _Trello_ under the _Cheat Sheets_ section and enjoy!
