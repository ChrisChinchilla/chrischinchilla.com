I&#8217;ve written this section in anticipation of questions, especially as this is a trial project to determine interest. I have tried to keep things very simple in lieu of a real online shop. Happy to answer further questions of course!

**How do I make an order?**

  1. Fill in the survey form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FhpefEhbsJrLObpX4wvk-PI2TlxwhjzPK1OStJnjr8o/viewform).
  2. You will then receive an invoice (including postage/delivery fee).
  3. Once paid via paypal, your order will be prepared.
  4. Your order will then be delivered/posted or made available for pick up.

**How do I pay?**
  
Please pay via paypal. You will receive the details after sending through your order request.

**Don&#8217;t have a paypal account? **
  
No problem, I will direct you how to pay using pay pal without an account.

**What is the minimum order?**
  
The minimum order for a gift box is €22 (plus delivery/postage).

**I want to send the box as a gift**
  
No problem, just specify the name and address of the recipient. We can even add a printed message from you in a gift card, no charge.

**How will I receive my order?**
  
You order will be posted or hand delivered (in Berlin) for a fee. You also have the alternative of picking up your box from Prenzlauer berg.

**Why don&#8217;t you post vegan cheese?**
  
Basically because it won&#8217;t be refrigerated during postage time. Also cheese is quite delicate and might get bumped around despite our best efforts to post the package securely.

**How long will delivery take?**
  
Where absolutely possible, we will hand deliver on the same day (if you book before 10am) or next day during business hours (Monday-Friday).

For hand deliveries there _must_ be someone to receive the package (ideally you or the gift recipient).Otherwise we will need to bring the package back with us and you will incur an additional charge for repeat delivery.

For postal deliveries, we will post on the same day and arrival will depend on the timing of Deutsch post. We will let you know when your box is posted!

If you request something that we are need to make more of (some cheeses take a while to cure), we will let you know and give you the option to order an alternative product.

**What will the box look like?**
  
We focus on providing quality products for foodies and ensuring that the box gets to you securely. We&#8217;ve done careful budgeting. We&#8217;d honestly rather spend your money on both of these factors rather than an expensive box or basket and gift wrap and cellophane.

You will receive a box (possibly recycled from an Amazon or Zalando order) and carefully
