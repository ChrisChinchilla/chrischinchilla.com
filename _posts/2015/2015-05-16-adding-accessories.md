Sorry for the lack of updates, I have been traveling with work the past few weeks.

However, I have managed to find the time to start adding accessories to the [product cards](/cards). Accessories are smaller products that can be attached to other products, even other players' products. They represent things like mice, keyboards and a plethora of others.

Generally they are small cost and small return, but let you take advantage of other products for cheap wins. There are more to come, I am currently researching what was actually released in the 80s.
