Last week I spent time on creating some of the common elements that can be found across all of the Gregarious Mammal sites, this includes:<ul><li>Creative Commons notice</li><li>Mailing List</li><li>Financially contributing to projects</li><li>Git and version information</li></ul>

The first two are complete and live, hopefully you can see them to the left. The second two are still in progress. I also fixed some layout issues, but they are not all live yet. So far, those built have been built as Drupal modules using a simple custom module and the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/mailchimp" target="_blank">mailchimp</a> module respectively. I decided to make them Drupal modules because for the time being, they will only be displayed on the Drupal sites, if this changes, I may rearchitect them. The later two will also be custom module,s but they're not finished yet, more detail when they are.
