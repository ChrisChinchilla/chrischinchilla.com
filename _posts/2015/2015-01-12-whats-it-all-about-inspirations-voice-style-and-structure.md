I guess most of its stylistic inspiration comes from Kurt Vonnegut and to a lesser extent surreal dark British comedy such as Douglas Adams. It is about the end of the world, but that isn't the point, it's just a vehicle. The fact that the world is ending isn't relevant, it's merely a surreal vehicle to explore elements of the human condition. Wow, that last sentence sounded pretentious!

Dismissing this major and significant event is intentional and draws inspiration from a strange book that I read some time ago (title forgotten) about a group of walking, talking dogs arriving in New York. Initially they were a novelty, but rapidly became 'yesterdays news' and I feel that this is sadly accurate for a lot of potentially major events in humanity. Most of us would have moved on to the next issue within a week and not really know what to do aside from what we normally do.

## Structure
As with everything I undertake, I am also using this 'book' as a method to try and explore new structures, ideas and financing models embracing open source ideals. The way the 'book' (lets call it 'work of fiction' from now on) will work is this.

I (currently) have two overarching chapters, one is about the lead up to the end of the world and the other is about what happens next. In each of these chapters, several stories, occurrences and ideas are mentioned in passing. Each of these could have a chapter linked to them and I have already written some of them, with more planned. Each of these subsequent stories also contain passing mentions that could lead to other stories.

The plan is that people can choose their own path through the interconnected stories and characters, which could grow indefinitely. I will create the initial batch of these stories for free, but at some point in the near future I will add a crowdfunding element. If you want a particular story written then you are able to bid for that to happen. Details are still being considered, but I'm calling it "Crowdfunded-Choose-Your-Own-Adventure". For now.

Accompanying each story will also be different media versions, including illustrations, readings, live performances and more.

## Voice and Style
As this is already an odd topic and method of delivery I am also taking quite a liberal and adventurous approach to the writing style. It will switch between narrative perspectives, it will be littered with broken sentences and passing words to create a particularly surreal style (very Vonnegut-esque) and I will be unashamedly breaking grammar rules to make it sound how I want the work to sound.

I think it is English in feeling and voice, without being specifically based anywhere. There will be focus on mundanity and petty bureaucracy, bored and frustrated people and seemingly uninteresting minutiae.

## What’s next?
I have the first overarching chapter nearly finished and the second started and I have several of the off-shoot stories written. The website is nearly ready and within the next month something will hopefully be online for first readings.

I'm looking forward to the End of the World and I hope you will enjoy it to.
