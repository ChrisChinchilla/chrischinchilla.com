One Day the World Ended is designed to be an open source and collaborative work of fiction. Most of this will come later when I have more material ready, but <a href="https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/One-Day-the-World-Ended-Jekyll" target="_blank">the code of the website is on GitHub</a> and you're more than free to issue pull requests if you want to.

At the moment there's one part of the work where you can contribute and I welcome your ideas, this is for the "<a href="https://onedaytheworldended.com/whatnext/" target="_blank">What happens next</a>" section of the introduction. This is a list of ideas about Worlds that replace our old one after its end. I will accept all reasonable and non-spam ideas and attempt to write a story based on your idea at some point in the future.

If you're technically minded you can create a pull request against this page. If not, but you are happy to create a GitHub account, you can <a href="https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/One-Day-the-World-Ended-Jekyll/blob/master/_posts/2015-03-22-what-came-next.md" target="_blank">directly edit the page here</a> and that will create a version of the page with your idea that I can consider. If you have an idea, but all of this makes no sense whatsoever, then [connect with me](/connect) and I will also consider your suggestion.
