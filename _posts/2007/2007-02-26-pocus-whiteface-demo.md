This is a demo, so I will treat it as such and offer Pocus Whiteface some constructive criticism, which I hope is what they want. There are some wonderful riffs here, some amazing crazy guitar noises, discordant chords, thundering bass lines (played by a brilliant bass player) and manic shouted vocals (though they could do with greater projection), all of which are good in my books. The bands' main flaws lie in their structure and arrangement, despite no song being longer than four and a half minutes at times they drag and feel a lot longer. The songs need more ups and downs, more hooks, better dynamics, bury yourselves in a studio for a bit, tear the songs apart, put them back together again and we'll have a mighty musical force on our hands.
