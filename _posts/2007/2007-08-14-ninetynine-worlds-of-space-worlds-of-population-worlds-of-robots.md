Ninetynine's live show is a stupendous feat of intense musicianship and song writing craft, so how a band takes such a show, commit it to record and lose none of the live buzz is a challenge. 'Worlds Of Space, Worlds Of Population, Worlds Of Robots√Æ makes a determined effort, and is twelve tracks of finely constructed, arranged and played songs of epic proportions, some beautiful, some inspiring, some fast and frantic, others slower and brooding. The production of the album lacks some sparkle that would have really brought out the songs in their entirety, Laura MacFarlane's vocal sometimes not quite possessing the punch and clarity they deserve and a general desire for a little more 'oomph'. Slight niggles with production quality aside the band's energy and passion for what they play still shines through, with tracks like 'Monster√Æ grabbing you and hurling your ears against the wall and the sincere, heartfelt strains of 'At the Backdoor√Æ pulling you into a melancholic world and bringing the slightest tear to your eye. A fine album from a fine band, it sounds cheesy, but it's not just an album, it's an experience.
