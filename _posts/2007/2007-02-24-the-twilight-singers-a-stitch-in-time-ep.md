Collaborations seem to be becoming increasingly popular, varying from perfect pairings to just plain embarrassing, this release is somewhere in-between. The first few tracks are brilliant; especially 'Live with me' that not only features Mark Lanegan on vocals sounding like the ghost of Johnny Cash, but is also a cover of a Massive Attack song. Tracks 2 and 3 are also wonderful dark laments, full of brooding bass lines and discordant chords, from here on the music remains fairly interesting and dark but the vocals become duller and more generic as we revert to the normal band line-up, which begs the question, who are the Twilight Singers?
