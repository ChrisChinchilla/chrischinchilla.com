I'm instantly suspicious of bands who try to make themselves sound a lot more interesting than they really are, if you've got nothing to say or it's too early in your career to have anything interesting to say on a press release, then just keep it simple, let the music talk for itself. Fortunately in the Vice's case the music does a fair job of this, despite being a low key and budget release. The band's sound is currently schizophrenic as they find their voice, fusing a few 'fashionable' styles and a few of their own ideas, thus they have the potential in sound, looks and attitude to be twisted into a marketing commodity, turned into whatever a label executive with a fat wallet desires them to become. At the moment the band's music has some honesty, rawness, some life, I hope it and they stay that way.
