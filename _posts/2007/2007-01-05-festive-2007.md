Well then, been a while since I last said something...<br /><br />Christmas was quiet, dull, so I guess that was a good Christmas, sat around a lot, watched telly, ate, argued with the family, typical stuff...<br /><br />Got back on the 28th and did a surreal gig with Jim, just the two of us, tried several new songs I'd written and then we did a few improvised songs together, it was most amusing and there was a fair audience to...<br /><br />We also had a great gig on the 30th at The Pop Art Birthday at Lark in the Park, you can see some great photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mapsmagazine/sets/72157594449794529" target="_blank">here</a> taken by Paul Maps... As you can see we now have a new guitarist, welcome 'Dan Lobster'. Jim and I also sat on a Questions panel and took part in Indie win lose or draw, all great fun.<br /><br />New Years eve was an odd one, sat about most of the day, dropped by on Chez Fruitbat to visit Les & Crissi and watch Time Team with them, then off to a party of a guy I used to work with which was pretty cool and I met his three foot Marijuana plant called 'Nicky'. Then Arran and Lydia turned up and convinced me to go to another party, where I never quite felt happy, so left about 2ish but it took ages to get home and I saw so much obnoxious behaviour it really depressed me... New years day was pleasant, took a very long walk from Aldgate to Tooting to meet Jim and a few others for Dinner...<br /><br />Then today I started working my way through the list of places I want to visit before I leave with my old Flatmate Carrie, though Westminster Abbey and St Pauls were stupidly expensive so we only ended up going to The London Museum instead and then a quick wander round the National Gallery...<br /><br />I recorded a new track over Christmas to, at the request of a guy in Australia who wanted to remix it, it's a live favourite called 'AAA', take a listen at <a href="https://www.chinchilla-music.co.uk/music.php" target="_blank">www.chinchilla-music.co.uk/music.php</a> where you can hear both remixes, or at <a href="https://www.myspace.com/chrischinchilla" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/chrischinchilla</a>.<br /><br />Overall though I've been feeling strange the past week, everything is in motion now for my return to Australia, booked the flight, visa is being processed and I can't wait to be there again, not least because I get to meet a lovely Lady again, but also because it has not taken me long at all to become fed up with London again, and be reminded of all the reasons behind this feeling, I'm just killing time at the moment, I can't wait until I can finally start something new and move on from a lot of past. I'm rambling slightly, it's hard to put some of the feelings I have on the subject into words without going into a lot of things from my past, I guess it basically boils down to "That was me then this is me now", I want to live a different life as a different sort of person, but when you're constantly surrounded by the trappings of old you, and some of those trappings refuse to give you a chance as the new you... If that makes any sense...<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I'm very excited, after a while of talking about it, I'm finally leaving the UK to pastures new...
