This week my column is something a little different, I've moved out of Indie Rock and it's a description of a demonstration of John Cage's Prepared Piano I saw during the Melbourne International Arts Festival, read it [here](https://www.indieoma.com/public_journal.php?d=6883966fd8f918a4aa29be29d2c386fb).

And Finally, a little plug... I've teamed up with Polka Dot Rabiit to make the 2007 Election Colouring Book, please take a look at [www.polkadotrabbit.com/election.php](https://www.polkadotrabbit.com/election.php) to find out more.
