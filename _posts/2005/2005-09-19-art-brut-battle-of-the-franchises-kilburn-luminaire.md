Tonight was going to be strange from the outset, attending a gig staged by kids because they were influenced to do so by my (ex) band. The minute I entered I felt awkward and proud simultaneously as I heard the excellent 'Criminal Housewives' and their Sham69 fused cover of 'My Little Brother'. Following them were 'LeboviciAB84', 'The Sam Assortment' and 'Space Peacocks' with their Glam fashions, bouncy tunes and intriguing fusion of 'Formed a Band' and 'Modern Art' resulting in a motley stage invasion. 'The Rocks' finished the night in inimitable style, but tonight was all about the kids, talking to the kids.
