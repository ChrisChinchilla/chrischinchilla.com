I started Aberfeldy's set in a grumpy mood, intentionally not wanting to enjoy their Scottish tinged Americana. Predominately because at their worst Aberfeldy are twee and twodlesome with songs about 70's fashions and late night TV presenters, which grates with me, but after three songs I was drawn into their happy go lucky world. Because at their best Aberfeldy pen pure slabs of sugar soaked pop, catchy, full of hooks, superb musicianship and loveably lyrics that are just too damn sweet to resist. So I left the gig in a great mood, skipping on the tube and smiling at strangers.
