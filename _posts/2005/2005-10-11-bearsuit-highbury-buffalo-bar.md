First piece of advice to Bearsuit, Buy at least one Tuner between you, second, Play in time. Work on that and your shouty girl, whiny boy vocals, bloopy keyboards, fuzzy guitars, fun lyrics and cute look will show of your catchy melodies 1000 times better. There are plenty of bands in the pop-punk genre (most 5 years ago) so stand out from the rest by buying gear that works and stop being so damn cute.
