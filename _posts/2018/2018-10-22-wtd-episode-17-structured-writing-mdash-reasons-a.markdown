In this Write the Docs podcast episode, we chat with Mark Baker about structured writing, specifically focusing on his new book [_Structured Writing: Rhetoric and Process_](https://www.amazon.com/Structured-Writing-Rhetoric-Mark-Baker/dp/1937434567). After introducing and defining structured writing, Mark explains the four domains you can add structure: media, document, subject, and management domains. He explains the advantages of working with structure in the subject domain, and why mixing structure across subject and document domains can be inefficient. We also chat about how structured writing connects with SEO and microformats on the semantic web, the limits of structure in Markdown formats, how to implement structure in linking, and more.
