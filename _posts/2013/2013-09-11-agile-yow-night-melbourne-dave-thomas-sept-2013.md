There seem to be more events not running free catering, is this due to a lack of sponsors or a change to methodology? A thought to ponder on…

This was what Dave called an "unplugged event" that contained some home truths from teams and businesses, so with respect for Dave, I will leave them out. I like his rawness. What follows is basically a list of tips I collected throughout the presentation:<ul><li>How to convince a business to go agile without implying it just means cheaper and faster. </li><li>With many large product companies agile is something they're trying, not a way of life. It's hard on leaders and hard to sustain.</li><li>Identify who can say yes and no to requirements and who can make timely decisions that may be wrong. </li><li>Respect remote teams, treat them as part of yours and get to know them.</li><li>Have specialists, but not people who think they are special and ruin a group dynamic. </li><li>Technical ladders are needed to allow due progression of tech folks without losing them to management. </li><li>Encourage staff to come to events and learn. </li><li>Have a product culture. Continuous improvement instead of quickly out the door. </li><li>Are they up for a true agile, continual integration culture,  it's not just putting teams in scrum. </li><li>Put everything in the backlog to feed all other systems. </li><li>Let product owners worry about big picture and everyone else worry about their areas. </li><li>If there are no acceptance criteria, tear up the story card. How can you measure it? </li><li>Envision your projects fully before commencing them.</li><li>Reduce the fear of developers giving estimates, but story points will scare people as not being formal enough. </li><li>Try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker" target="_blank">planning poker</a>/wide  band Delphi. </li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Try "Extreme design" </li><li>Refactoring is nigh on impossible in larger projects,  it's basically rewriting. </li><li>Dave doesn't like dependencies and frameworks. Object oriented programming Introduces complexity.</li><li>Feeds can be better and easier than apis. Learn about queries.</li><li>Scripting can help getting things done quicker. </li><li>Simple loose coupling between components. </li><li>It's ok to use and try different tools and languages. </li><li>Think outside the box.</li></ul>
