I&#39;m working on a book/presentation/series of workshops/who knows what covering integrating lean and agile practices into a non-profit or social enterprise. As a sub set of that will also be &quot;What the non-profit world can learn from the tech world and vice versa&quot;.

It&#39;s still taking shape, it&#39;s still to be completely defined, but that&#39;s the plan.
