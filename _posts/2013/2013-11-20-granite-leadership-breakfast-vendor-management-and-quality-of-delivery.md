title: Granite Leadership breakfast - Vendor Management & Quality of Delivery
created: 1384941483
---


First up, I find it strange how different sectors describe the same things with different names and have the same problems. It&#39;s simultaneously refreshing and depressing that small and large organisations have exactly the same problems with their projects.

<strong>Small or large, what is the fundamental problem?</strong><br />&nbsp;

<em>Here&#39;s my bullet point thoughts on the breakfast</em><ul><li>Vendor management = project management etc</li><li>Deliver more that you promise, not the other way around</li><li>Beware of a lack of skills on customer side</li><li>Get yes in writing</li><li>Involvement from all, agile principles</li><li>Uniqueness of supplier and contractors, even if requirements are the same</li><li>Document the need for any specialists</li><li>What do vendors get out of a project,&nbsp; treat them as partners. Understand your Vendor, their strengths and weaknesses.</li><li>What role does a contract have in a project?&nbsp; A stick, a backup, legalise, scope of project? Or are they too meaningless and vague.</li><li>Measurements, but also what actions will happen as a result of certain measurements.</li><li>What is the chain of command</li><li>Have key kpis in contracts</li><li>What is the internal hiring process and ethics of vendors,&nbsp; especially if relying on a resident specialist.</li><li>Spend some time with those who will be working on you project.</li><li>Ask for pieces of the project, screenshots, tests</li></ul>
