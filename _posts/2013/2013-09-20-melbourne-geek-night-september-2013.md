<p align="left">The speaker line ups and topics keep getting better for the Melbourne geek nights and tonight is no expection.<p align="left"><strong>Ophelie Lechat from Flippa talking about &quot;Tackling the scary content marketing beast&quot;</strong><br />I&#39;ve been doing some of this myself recently, so it was interesting to hear some more in depth on te topic from a commercial perpective, here&rsquo;s what I got out of the session:<ul><li>Content isn&rsquo;t just a blog</li><li>Have editorial calendars</li><li>Content strategy and marketing are best friends as the discipline helps attract seo and web traffic, this in turn reduces demand on customer support and partnerships. good for engagement.</li><li>Assess what content you already have. If it&#39;s not content it may be existing skills or assets.</li><li>Writing for your site can be empowering for team members</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of ghost and hired writers.</li><li>Decide what will you talk about and don&#39;t just talk to and about yourself. Identify what others don&#39;t do or do badly.</li><li>ebooks of collections of posts are a great marketing idea.</li><li>What to write about - questions that need answering, searches on your site. What conversations are people having elsewhere? If you get stuck, write an outline first.</li><li>Keep your content as short as possible, focus, end with engagement, what do users/readers want?</li></ul>

<strong>Steve Sammartino, Serial startup guy talking about &quot;The End of Demographics&quot;</strong><br />This was an interesting presentation around the modern word of consumer advertsing an dpurchasing, I wasn&rsquo;t completely convinced by all of what was said, but still.

Some concepts were&hellip; Are stats and reporting tired trends, remove the word &lsquo;consumer&rsquo; and we are humans. We are no longer exclusively in circles of production and consumption. we can have what we want now (really?). Media doesn&#39;t shape our minds anymore (really?).

It&#39;s not technology anymore, it&#39;s connections. We are now wider spread with disposable technology. Fragmentation is a good thing for choice and new chances and entrants. Frequency has replaced proximity. And to finalise&hellip; big data is simpler than it sounds!

<strong>Megan Dell from MYOB treating us to a repeat of the talk she did at UX Australia about &quot;Weekly user testing&quot;</strong><ul><li>Bring your customers in to watch and test and don&#39;t cancel the habits you create.</li><li>How to recruit potential tester - not email surveys, conventional surveys didn&#39;t work well either as you may not record details that are needed and then it&#39;s too late. A dedicated person (intern) helped as did just doing it yourself, exploiting your existing relationships and just asking people.</li><li>Undertaking tests &ndash; Be prepared to travel to clients, get a wide gamut of people and tests, be ready to go for whenever there&rsquo;s a potential.</li><li>Have a rough plan and how people can add to it. Have a process to handle the process.</li></ul>
