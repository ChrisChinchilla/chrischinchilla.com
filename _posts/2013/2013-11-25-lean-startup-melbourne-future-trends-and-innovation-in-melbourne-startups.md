November has been a great month for meet-ups, perhaps everyone wrapping up for the year is making organisers up the ante.

**Google glass / Wearables**

This is the first time i've really seen a Google Glass in the flesh and they do look a bit odd and distracting. The developer world is now growing and open. It provides a chronological view and you have to talk or touch to do things,  so not as intrusive? It still looks a little unresponsive and i'd love to know what it doesn't look like projected onto a  screen. Future applications could include replacing actions that require more than one hand, such as warehouses. There were discussions over copyright and constant filming and social appropriate. I asked about the possibility for distraction, eyes always darting around, but the speaker asked back, what about cab drivers, they have multiple screens in front of them. It beeps to alert but won't display if you are driving.

**Lab on a chip**

Miniaturising labs for cost and convenience, some already exist, pregnancy test, glucose,  some blood tests. Future applications could include DNA sequencing, Personal health monitoring, Water contamination and monitoring, On chip desalination (low throughput). How to monetise this and get over Security and privacy concerns.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab-on-a-chip" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab-on-a-chip</a>

**Lifx**

You may have heard of these fantastic lightbulbs that are controllable by a mobile app and part of the 'internet of things', they did rather well on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limemouse/lifx-the-light-bulb-reinvented" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. You can control Colour and brightness, set up Grouping, scenes and more.

These are now possible due to components being cheaper/smaller, smart phone proliferation and open apis now for many devices and technologies. There are so many potential applications and integrations for Lifx (one of mine was entertainment lighting), they are also yet to figure out the best way to handle security and power consumption. They also work with a normal switch(!) and are about $80 each.<br /><a href="https://lifx.co/" target="_blank">lifx.co</a>

**Tomcar **

I have no interest in cars, but some good points were made on how to run and manage a lean manufacturing company.<ul><li>Having no money and no idea will help you not worry about how hard and expensive it is.</li><li>Lack of legacy infrastructure helps</li><li>Dealers make more money (effectively) than manufacturers. </li><li>Leverage  modern supply chain</li><li>If you have tools and production line you feel compelled to use it. </li><li>Ford and sloan. One model verses customisation</li><li>Tomcar has an after market for extras, i.e. an app store</li><li>Find where you can get free marketing</li><li>Not currently street legal </li><li>Create a strong self interest to maintain integrity in supply chain.</li></ul>

iPhone case with bottle opener. Also kickstarted, but a lot simpler. All products are 3d printed (which have been around since 70s, so longer than you may expect), this helps with constant iteration and customisation (Annex also sells model files on Shapeways to aid customers who want one off customisations). Piracy control still an open issue to be tackled.<br /><a href="https://www.annexproducts.com/" target="_blank">www.annexproducts.com</a>
