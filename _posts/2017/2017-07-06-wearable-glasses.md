Over the last year, I’ve noticed a renewed interest in wearable glasses. Sure there’s plenty of mask-like goggles on the market for game playing, but glasses have emerged as a product in development by a number of tech companies. There’s been plenty of rumors that Apple glasses will be with us by 2020. The rumors have been given stronger credence by a leaked Occupational Health and Safety report at Apple that referred to "After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to an optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.”
