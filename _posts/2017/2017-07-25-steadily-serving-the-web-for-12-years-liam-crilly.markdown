NGINX is one of the most popular web servers on the internet. Just a shade behind the market leader it emerged roughly ten years ago to provide an alternative to the venerable Apache, designed to suit modern traffic demands better and more appropriately.

On a hot Friday afternoon I spoke with Liam Crilly, the director of product management at NGINX to discuss the history of the project, the differences between the open and enterprise versions and answer questions posed by DZone readers. These questions included the status of HTTP/2, API access, and the choice of configuration file format.
