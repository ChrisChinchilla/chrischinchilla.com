                Two presentations -- Transitioning into API Technical Writing. A person whoâ€™s thinking of specialising in API tech writing may reflect on a number of fair questions ... And The Corilla Story. David Ryan will talk about the journey of a bunch of technical writers that started to tinker with some code in a back room at Red Hat's Brisbane office.
