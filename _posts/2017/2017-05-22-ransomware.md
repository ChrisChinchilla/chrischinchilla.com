Imagine a scenario where you wake up late as the smart coffee pot and alarm combo did not wake you up. To make it worse, the coffee isn't made. The shower is cold as the preset thermostat didn't kick in at 6 am. The internet is down. On your walk to the metro, you discover that the traffic lights are out, and police are everywhere, attempting to control traffic by hand signals. The metro is closed as the ticket machines won't work, the barriers won't open and besides, the autonomous trains can't operate. You try to order an uber but the phone lines are jammed and you can't get through. You try to get money out of the ATM to buy a coffee somewhere but the machine is broken. You then receive an SMS from your boss telling you that the computers wonâ€™t work and there's a popup message on the screen asking for bitcoin in exchange for data and "oh and do we still have a fax machine somewhere in the basement?"
