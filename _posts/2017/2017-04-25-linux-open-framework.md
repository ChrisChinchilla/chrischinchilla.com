The Linux Foundation this week announced the launch of EdgeX Foundry at Hanover Messe, an open source project to build a common open framework for IoT edge computing and an ecosystem of interoperable components that unifies the marketplace and accelerates enterprise and Industrial IoT. The initiative is aligned around a common goal: the simplification and standardization of industrial IoT edge computing, while still allowing the ecosystem to add significant value.
