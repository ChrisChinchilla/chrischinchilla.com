I wrote my first book, and it's the 2nd edition of SitePoint's "Jump Start Responsive Web Design" covering all you need to get started with responsive web design, ideally you can read it in a weekend and start applying the knowledge on Monday.

As it was my first book it took a while to write and the process of having to create a cohesive collection of content that follows a narrative was a challenge I hadn't faced before.

There are lots of options to buy the book, and if you use [this link](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-responsive-web-design-2nd-edition?aref=cward), I will even make affiliate fees from your purchase üòÅ.

Thanks!
