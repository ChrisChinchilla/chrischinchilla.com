I spoke with Robert Reeves, CTO and Co-founder of Datical, a company that aims to remove the pain that database administrators (DBAs) experience on a regular basis attempting to make changes to database heavy applications.

They do this by bringing easy to use tools inspired by practices from the DevOps world to the traditionally messy world of enterprise databases, with change simulation, rollbacks, rules engines, packaging databases as code and strong monitoring.
