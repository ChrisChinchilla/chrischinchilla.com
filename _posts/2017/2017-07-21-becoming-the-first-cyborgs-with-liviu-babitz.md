While sci-fi predicted sweeping changes in cyborgs, like limb replacement, the truth probably lies in a smaller start, like embedding sensors in our bodies. Liviu Babitz, Founder of Cyborg Nest, agrees, predicting that we will instead look to add new senses or enhance those we already have in small and subtle ways. Liviu began with a small sensor that vibrates when he is facing north, in itself not the most useful sense to possess, but a step in the right direction to show what could be possible.
