In this episode I speak with Réda Berrehili of the [Ki Foundation](https://foundation.ki/team) about their plans to put blockchain-powered assistants into hotel rooms. I also cover the Linux desktop wars are over, the Nintendo power glove, and those pesky under water cables giving us all the internet we need (most of the time).
