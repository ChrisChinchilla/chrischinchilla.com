These guidelines are a community resource. They are meant to help guide and inform you through your development process and ensure the highest quality results in your smart contract system and your end product. The original version of these guidelines lives on the Gitbook at SecurEth Guidelines. The version there will always be the most up to date, but I will work to keep both versions the same.
