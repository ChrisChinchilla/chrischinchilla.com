In this first episode of The Enthusiastic amateur I speak with [Sinclair Target](https://sinclairtarget.com) of the [two-bit history blog](https://twobithistory.org) telling you some of what you need to know about computing history.

We discuss:

- [The Rise and Demise of RSS](https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html)
- [What Did Ada Lovelace's Program Actually Do?](https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/18/ada-lovelace-note-g.html)
- [Whatever Happened to the Semantic Web?](https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html)

And so much more.
