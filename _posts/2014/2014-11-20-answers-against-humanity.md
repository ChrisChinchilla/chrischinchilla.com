Are you looking for smart answers to dumb questions? Then you might enjoy 'Answers Against Humanity', based on that 'award' winning game, Cards Against Humanity.

Code is available on [iOS](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/Answers-Against-Humanity) and [Android](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/AnswersAgainstHumanity), but you'll only find it in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gregariousmammal.com.answersagainsthumanity) as Apple said it was:

> Too dumb

for their store.
