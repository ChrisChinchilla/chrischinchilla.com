I&rsquo;ve been attending the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-KMLF/events/142133462/"  target="_blank">Knowledge Management Melbourne</a> sessions without still being entirely clear what a Knowledge manager actually is, but I find the topics they present interesting and relevant, so&hellip;

Tonight&rsquo;s topic was a paratactical session on facilitation techniques, which is something I undertake occasionally so was interested in hearing some ideas and suggestions.

These were both techniques from Thiaga (<a href="https://www.thiagi.com" ><span class="s2">www.thiagi.com</a>).

First was &lsquo;Reverse brainstorming&rsquo;, where instead of focusing on the positive, solution based approach to breaking out an idea, you look backwards, so for example instead of brainstorming &ldquo;How will we get senior management buy in?&rdquo;, we brainstormed &ldquo;How will we not get senior management buy in?&rdquo;. This was a good technique for engaging people who are hard to engage as it&rsquo;s fun and get people saying things that maybe they always really wanted to say.

This then led to the next exercise, which is &rsquo;35&rsquo; a sorting and prioritising exercise. Take the previous negative outcomes, reverse them, then write them onto cards and get your audience to swap them weigh each other 5 times, discussing how they would rate the point from 1-7. Finally, add up the scores on the back of each card and this gives a good indication of what needs to be prioritised.

Well, that&rsquo;s the summary anyway&hellip;
