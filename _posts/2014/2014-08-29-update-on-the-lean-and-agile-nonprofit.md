title: Update on The Lean and Agile Nonprofit

A little while back I announced my intention to write a book on some techniques and ideas incorporating Lean and Agile methodologies into the&nbsp;not-for-profit&nbsp;sector. I made some good headway but it became fairly apparent to me quite quickly that maybe I didn&#39;t have quite enough material (right now) to produce a complete book. Well as luck would have it I met up with highly experienced not-for-profit consultant, Donnie Maclurcan and he mentioned his &#39;Not-for-Profit Handbook&#39; project that he was struggling to find the time to finish.

To cut a long story short we decided to collaborate, with me incorporating my lean and agile ideas (and several others) into the book and us co-authoring the book together.

Here&#39;s an update on what we&#39;ve done so far&hellip;

I joined Donnie in Ashland, Oregon and for six days we worked intensively on the book and have now managed to:<ul><li>Draft the preface and three of the book&rsquo;s five substantive chapters</li><li>Incorporate notes from Donnie&rsquo;s six years of not-for-profit consultancy in Australia</li><li>Incorporate notes from my initial &#39;Lean and Agile nonprofit&#39; ideas</li><li>Develop a basic website,&nbsp;<a href="https://notforprofithandbook.org">notforprofithandbook.org</a>, including a first draft of the tools referenced in the book at&nbsp;<a href="https://notforprofithandbook.com/toolbox/">notforprofithandbook.com/toolbox/</a> (we&rsquo;ll be updating the design, content and formatting of the site over the coming months)</li></ul>

A Big thanks to Stephen Couling, Francis Le, AJ Tennant, Jennifer Hinton, Sarah Reibstein and Camile Duran for assistance with editing.

At this stage we&rsquo;re on track for launch by December, and look forward to getting this to you in time for the festive season!

This doesn&#39;t mean that the &#39;Lean and Agile nonprofit&#39; project is over, this is just the beginning!
