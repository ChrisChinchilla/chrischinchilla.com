**Deciding when What you know is wrong - Peter Wilson**

Changing and moving on, learning. Things you know can become wrong with new techniques and practices emerging.. act like you're always going live, you will make the right decision. Reread old code and articles. Don't work in a vacuum and embrace change.

**Pact - Beth skurrie**

Moving away from large monolithic code bases into micro chunks. Throw away the integration tests, they can slow things down. Probably best you take a look at <a href="https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact" style="line-height: 1.538em;" target="_blank">Pact's GitHub</a> for more details.

**Maurio Visic, a faster web**

Web is slow because of what we added to it... The visual additions of Netscape and the demands and extras we added, css, web fonts, images etc... slow sites impact conversion rates. To help use Web speed tests, <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.yahoo.com%2Fyslow%2F&ei=n_xBU6TJFsPdkgW83YGQCg&usg=AFQjCNFmoZ-gRFU3niH49DI2h8-FUZixJw&sig2=SPrxxye93EmvU94f84B-gw&bvm=bv.64125504,d.dGI" target="_blank">Yslow</a>, <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank">webpagetests</a>, google etc... Start working on it now.

**Innovating the open source business model, Shane from Silverstripe**

Both client and developers want more for less. All open source communities say their advantage is the size of their community, the amount of modules they have and that everyone is using it. That's what the others say... So Silverstripe do the opposite. Open Source vs proprietary, how do you differentiate, that's the new argument. Personally, Silverstripe seem to offer similar things to other communities really, do they support developers who don't work for them? Warranties etc aren't anything new. premium support etc.

**Typescript**

Typed JavaScript. Good JavaScript generator. Classes, vars, semicolons. Nesting. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">www.typescriptlang.org</a>

**Bikeshedding - Drew from reactive**

Clients often miss the big details and focus on small things like logo and colours. You need to feel the confidence to say "I know what I'm doing, I'm an expert". Websites are hard projects. Why do clients do this? A loss of control, scared,  they don't understand what's going on, help them through the process.

**Webgl - Alex mackey**

3d content onto web pages, take a look at <a href="https://www.simpleisbest.co.uk/" target="_blank">Alex's blog</a> for more details.

**Design by community - Dimitri**

Don't design at people. Be brave and democratic and Involve people. Give them clear tasks and timeliness on what to do. Take discussions piece by piece, remain focused. Pick passionate users and people with opinions. codesign, not committee, you can say no.

**Windows Phone - Lars Klint**

Awesome things about Windows Phone: Mixradio, cameras, Nokia... custom Uri mappings for settings. Lots of Google features out of the box, audio, codes, make you rich...
