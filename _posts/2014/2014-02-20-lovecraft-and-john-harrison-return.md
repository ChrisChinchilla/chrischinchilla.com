I have the fantastic opportunity to represent two of my favourite non-tech talks from last year, I&#39;m back at Laneway Learning to present my &quot;<a href="/cosmic-horror-hp-lovecraft">Cosmic Horror &amp; HP Lovecraft talk</a>&quot; on March 5th, you can <a href="https://melbourne.lanewaylearning.com/classes/cosmic-horror-and-hp-lovecraft/?utm_content=buffer21da4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">book in at the Laneway Learning website</a>. I&#39;m also presenting a segment of my &quot;<a href="/mapping-and-why-your-view-world-wrong">Mapping and why your view of the world is wrong</a>&quot; talk at <a href="https://thelaborastory.com/" target="_blank">The Laborastory</a> about John Harrison on the 1st April.

I hope to see you there!
