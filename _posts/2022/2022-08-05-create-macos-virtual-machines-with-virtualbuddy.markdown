VirtualBuddy can virtualize macOS 12 and later on Apple Silicon, with the goal of offering features that are useful to developers who need to test their apps on multiple versions of macOS, especially betas. The project is in early stages, but I found with minimal configuration it helps you get a virtual machine up and running quickly and efficiently.
