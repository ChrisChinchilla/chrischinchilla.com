As part of a sponsorship for my podcast I spent two weeks with Magic Mind, that claims to be the world’s first productivity shot. How did its ingredients of Matcha, Nootropics, Adaptogens, Honey, and other goodies help me relax, get focus, and energy over 14 days? In this video diary I recount my experiences and dig into what the ingredients in the shot claim to do.
