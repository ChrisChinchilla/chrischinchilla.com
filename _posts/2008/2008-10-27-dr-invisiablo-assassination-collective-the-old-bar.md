Dr Invisiablo either play incredibly complex music and make it look ridiculously simple or they play incredibly simple music and give the impression that it's incredibly complex. Either way their blend of highly arranged Punk-Pop-Hard-Rock is highly effective with all members firing on full cylinders, drummer Adam Pedretti particularly intimidating the audience with his ability to let rip insanely amazing drum patterns with ease. Tonight is only a two band bill so Dr Invisiablo have plenty of time to show us what their made of and at no time during their set (not even with an Elvis cover) do they detour into dullsville, supplying this quiet Wednesday night with a band worth keeping an eye on.<br>The Assassination Collective remain one of the nosiest, shambolic and chaotic bands in Melbourne but have been uncharacteristically quiet of late, presumably with a raft of 'other commitments' getting in the way of shows. Or perhaps taking time out to observe the new government in order to craft a fresh batch of charged political anthems regarding the 'change'. This month long residency gives the band an opportunity to showcase a handful of new numbers as well as let rip with a few old favourites. The 'Collective' in the bands name is appropriately descriptive of what to expect at a show, all members (Excluding Simon on Bass) swapping and interchanging instruments every few songs, injecting an element of differing character into each line up and song. It also leads to a slightly messy set as booze and confusion reigns supreme, resulting in the impression that no one is really sure what is supposed to happen next and equally that no one really cares as long as there's some noise and alcohol involved. The most enjoyable thing about an Assassination collective show is that for a most random looking bunch of individuals, for the amount of noise they make, for the amount of screaming and shouting, for the amount of gear and band members, for the amount of Politics and social commentary in their songs, is that they manage to get any gigs at all, but thank God they do, Melbourne needs them.
