<b>How did everything begin, why did you want to get into music in the first place? </b>

To be part of something, it was part of my culture, getting into DJ'ing and remixing, then making records and things develop from there.

<b>What's different between your live sets and DJ sets, and which do you prefer? </b>

I don't have any particular favourites, the ultimate buzz comes from working on a track and it all clicks into place. Everything balances each other out really; complimenting each other and giving you a different perspective on your music, live you get to perform your own songs, DJ'ing you get to test them on a different crowd. Then there's the artwork and visual side of things which is a great chance to work with more visual ideas and maintain an identity throughout your music, and I enjoy doing it all, that process of picking up a record sleeve and looking at who was involved and who did what has always been an intrinsic part of appreciating music to me.

<b>Is there a particular look you go for, or does it depend on the release? </b>

It depends on the release.

<b>How do you about writing and producing your material? </b>

Again, it depends, if it's a collaboration it will vary from your own stuff. With the collaborations you're creating something more specific, with a better idea of what sound you're trying to achieve, whereas with your own material things just develop from nowhere into expressing a feeling or reaction.

<b>When it comes to collaborations, do you pick them or do they pick you? </b>

A bit of both, you meet people and get along and collaboration happens, and other times you're looking for someone to achieve something specific, they generally come from more personal relationships.

<b>Do you get a feeling for a song when you meet somebody? </b>

That tends to be what happens.

<b>Which collaboration do you feel has been the best representation of the collaborator? </b>

That's a tough one to answer, everyone brings something different, there's always classics like 'A rabbit in the Headlights√Æ, 'Rain√Æ, tracks that have come together in certain way, every record and process has it's own moments and feeling, it's hard to pick out one over another.

<b>Why is it do you think that a lot of 'Dance' Music artists have so many collaborations? </b>

It's like old school song writing, you have a groove that fit's people. It's more instrumental music that doesn't always fit into the traditional 'pop' song arrangement.

<b>Have you been to Australia before? </b>

Yes, lots of times, for DJ'ing, live shows, various things.

<b>Who have you collaborated with here? </b>

Pav from Modular, Ben Lee a few years ago.

<b>Anyone you'd like to collaborate with?</b>

Bumblebeez, midnight Juggernauts, Nick Cave
