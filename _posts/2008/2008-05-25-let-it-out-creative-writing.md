Tell me what the matter is, I really want to know.

Don't keep it to yourself; you've got to let it go.

Don't tell me it's not important, I really do care.

Don't tell me another time, lay your burden bare.

Don't sit there feeling sorry with your head against the wall.

Talk to me, relate, and forget about it all.
