Here's a quote/analogy I've been using for a while to overarchingly describe a strategy for engaging on social media that I've found helpful and descriptive.

> If you walk into a bar and all you do is stand on the bar, screaming and shouting about yourself, would you expect anyone to engage with you? It's the same with social mediaâ€¦

In follow up to that and the issue of privacy, here's another analogy.

> If you then started telling everyone where your keys were, your movements for the day, where your valuables were, your fears and weaknesses and a bunch of other personal details. You would expect some repercussions.
