These are songs for summer, beautiful close melodies, upbeat harmonies and wonderful lyrical couplets. But the weather outside is confused, and so seemingly is the band, the sound is not brilliant, everyone looks constantly surprised and lost. However it comes across as charming, complimenting the music well and Jim Noir get away with it.
