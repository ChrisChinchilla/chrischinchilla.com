There's an odd sound and feeling to Winterkids' single, track one seems to be veering dangerously to sounding like an early 90's baggy anthem, whilst the b-side is doing a very good impression of a pop-heavy-rock hit which would get the 13 year olds in baggy jeans and hoodies moshing like mad. Throughout both the tracks the vocal has some horrible production on it, it's so compressed and so saturated with reverb it's a real effort to listen to, this is what gives both the tracks the odd sound they have. I get the feeling a better opinion of the band could be formed by seeing them live.
