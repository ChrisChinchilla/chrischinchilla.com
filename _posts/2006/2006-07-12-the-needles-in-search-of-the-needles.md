I've been aware of the Needles for some time, this album has been a while in the making and it gives the feeling that the songs were possibly written over a long period of time; it's a schizophrenic sounding album. Some songs are straight ahead power rock songs, others reminiscent of 60's ballads whilst others are more contemporary sounding rock songs. Therein lies the problem, the more contemporary sounding and the fast, frantic rock songs are the highlights, things start to tire around the middle of the album where there are too many organ led slower songs, fortunately everything kicks back in for the last few tracks and the album ends on a high. Not the smoothest journey but fundamentally rewarding, much as (I hope) it has been for the band.
