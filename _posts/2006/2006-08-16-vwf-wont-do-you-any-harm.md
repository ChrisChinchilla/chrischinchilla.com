It's always hard to judge a band on one track, but on the basis of this one I'd like to reiterate a statement to VWF and many, many other bands I have been making fairly frequently over the past few months... Please, please, please no more disco beats for the hell of it! Yes they make people dance, but there are other ways to do that. I say this in relation to VWF because they sound like a band who'd rather be playing some sort of ska/rock-riffage crossover, and whilst that might not be 100% original either, follow what is right for you, not what the scene is telling you to do.
