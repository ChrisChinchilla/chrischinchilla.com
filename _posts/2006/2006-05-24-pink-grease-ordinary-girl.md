The two tracks on Pink Grease's forthcoming offering has a wonderful tension throughout both tracks. The lyrics to Ordinary girl ooze with an impassioned plea, for what who don't know, but it's very effective! Hate has a similar feel, it's tension supplied by a confession of sorts, a claustrophobic outburst against the world or perhaps more personal. One thing's for sure, Pink Grease have thrown aside their lighter past for a new darker outlook on the world and a tighter sound to fulfil it, good luck to 'em.
