A bubble machine is on stage pumping into the audience, a strobe flashing near the drum kit as the 7 members of Delta Mainline awkwardly squash onto the small stage in front of an already warmed up audience. The venue is too small for their big sound, occasionally hard to define and losing distinction when the whole band is in full swing. Delta Mainline create big epic slabs of noise, building multiple layers of melodies and noise and for the most part without becoming too self-indulgent. Vocally there's not a massive amount going on, enough to hold your interest and a few hooks here and there, but generally too soaked in reverb to pick much out which is probably for the best anyway.
