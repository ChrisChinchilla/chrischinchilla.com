The Immediate's careful and beautifully crafted melodies are somewhat lost in the echoes of a half empty Scala tonight. These are pop songs of the highest calibre, the kind that would be critically acclaimed and incredibly commercially successful if handled correctly. The band are already winning over the 7.30 crowd tonight, give them 6 months and the Immediate will be everywhere.
