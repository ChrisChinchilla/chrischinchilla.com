Ludes sound messy and ear splittingly loud tonight, but with upbeat music comprising equal parts ska, strut, swing and old style dirty rock & roll, a full barfly is pulsating with sweaty bodies and beats. The singer's in the crowd, the guitarists are all over the place, the drummer's wild and the crowd are spilling pints on each other, any band who can get most of a London venue dancing on a Tuesday night deserves respect.
