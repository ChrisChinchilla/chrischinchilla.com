The show of a skilled solo artist is the ability to fill a room with your sound and presence, and whilst The Social is a small venue, Findlay fills all corners of the room admirably. His melodies and harmonies are haunting but beautiful, filling you with an enormous sense of calm and stillness. At the end of his set he quietly finishes and disappears into the room, his unassuming manner unaware of his effect on the audience.<br><br><a href='https://www.findlaybrown.com' target='_blank'>www.findlaybrown.com</a>
