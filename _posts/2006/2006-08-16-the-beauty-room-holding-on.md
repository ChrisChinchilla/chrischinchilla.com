Yee Gods, why are people still making, releasing or most crucially sending people like me such middle of the road Funk-Soul Ballads?! To be more constructive, it's well played, catchy and well structured songs, but sounds like late 70's pop music. Chiming vibraphones, a singer who's probably clicking his fingers whilst singing, string backings and falsetto middle eights. If you like this sort of thing then I'm sure it's great, but sadly the Beauty room are not my musical cup of tea at all.
