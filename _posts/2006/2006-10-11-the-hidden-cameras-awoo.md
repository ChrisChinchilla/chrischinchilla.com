An eclectic and eccentric bunch, The Hidden Cameras are a bunch of ever evolving Canadians, doing crazy things and not really fitting in. Awoo possesses that clever feel a lot of Canadian music has, fast, frantic lyrics full of witticism and sung in a deep, throaty voice, twinkling, jangling guitars, keyboards and sparkling strings offsetting the vocal style beautifully. Personally though I prefer the B-side, Why I understand, it's more upbeat, more in your face, but does sound like it was made in the 80's.
