Awwblot (for short) are an extremely competent and confident 5 piece from Worcester, who take the increasingly popular dual boy/girl vocals trick and fortunately aren't irritating. This 4 track EP has its ups and downs, the lead track, Dance, Damn you, dance is an anthem in the making showing off all the bands lyrical and musical talent in one convenient package. The problem with an outstanding track on a CD is that it makes the others, whilst perfectly fine in their own right, not seem so strong. Awwblot are a potential future hit band in the making, grab a copy of their early CD's before Paul Epworth gets his mitts on them and makes them all bloody disco.
