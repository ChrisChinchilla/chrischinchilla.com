Mattafix sound like the prevalent Ragga/Reggae/Pop lite that used to bother the charts in the early 90's, I'm not entirely sure who this is aimed at these days. The CD has one A-side and then seven remixes of the same track which is a little self indulgent, some sound no different, whilst others sound nothing like the main track. I gather the band are popular in parts of Europe and amongst warmer climates such as South Africa and Australasia, but sadly in rainy Britain, they're not for me.
