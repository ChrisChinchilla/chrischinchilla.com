The Voices are not the sort of band I'd normally go for; I gather they call it Shoe-gazing, basically lots of noise, not much structure, just repeated, building patterns. However, there's something about The Voices that pulls me in, firstly I guess I'm impressed by the noise they make for a three piece, there's also something wonderfully calming and ethereal about the tracks on this album, they wash over you, enveloping your senses, and forcing you to just stop and listen. An excellent soothing antidote to the crazy and confused modern world.
