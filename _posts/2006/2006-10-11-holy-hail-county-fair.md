Not a solo artist as the name may suggest, but a New Wave band hailing from New York, and damn it for one track samplers, I like what I hear, but it's not enough to get a fully fledged opinion. Some ubiquitous disco beats and funky bass lines but they simply can't be escaped at the moment, so might as well accept them. Clever dual boy / girl vocals and a great sparse sound filled out with some clever arrangements. Oh and of course they look great to, but that doesn't matter, does it.
