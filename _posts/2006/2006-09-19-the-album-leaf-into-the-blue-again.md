There's something of a melodious beauty to the tracks on Into the blue again, so much so that a majority of the tracks are purely instrumentals. It?∆í√ôs laid back, the usual band line up supplemented with strings, vibes, keyboards, samples and multiple vocalists. The songs are slow building, with layers of instruments and harmony gradually added as opposed to straightforward verse, chorus, verse chorus. A calming and peaceful album full of inspiring melody, it's the sort to return to after a hard days work, put your feet up with a glass of wine and drift away into another world with.
