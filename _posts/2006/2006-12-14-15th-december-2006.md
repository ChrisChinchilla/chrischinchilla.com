Personally I think <a href="https://media.nothingtoxic.com/uploads/4d7d011778fc4d6891bcedbec9710967.swf" target="_blank">this</a> is great...<br />A few odd things seen the past few days... - Bacardi are advertising 0 sugar, isn&#39;t Rum made from Sugar Cane?<ul><li>The new Burger King Angus is certified 100% Beef, do BK feel that their products are mistrusted so much they have to get them certified? And who does that? What a job...</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Saw a sign for a Family restaurant... That appealed to my sense of humour... &quot;How would you like your Grandmother sir? Roasted or Fried?&quot;</li></ul>

That&#39;s it for now...
