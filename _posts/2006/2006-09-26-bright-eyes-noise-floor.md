I've never really been a fan or understood the appeal of Bright Eyes, so a collection of rarities and unreleased tracks was never something I was going to be taken with. I don't like his funny warbling voice or his lyrics, the music's alright, but nothing special, to be short, I don't get it. The tracks on this album are probably for hardcore fans only, some being poorly recorded, whilst others are not going to be his best material, otherwise they would heave been released already. For a completei-st, an essential addition to your collection, but for enquiring, aspiring converts, best avoided.
