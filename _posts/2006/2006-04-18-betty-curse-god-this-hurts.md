I can't quite figure out if Betty Curse is the next (Glam Metal) Avril Lavigne or if she's doing this seriously, and with collaborations from 80's Matchbox B-Line Disaster and Little Hell I'm still not sure. Either way the album promises to be a great head banger of an album, loud powerful guitars, and lyrics about blood, relationships, being young and religion. All the Goth Kids in Camden Town now have a new figure head, I foresee a London Astoria all ages show within 6 months and Charing Cross road full of sweaty 14 year olds resplendent in black being picked up by their parents in four wheel drives by 11 pm. Seriously though this album is great, sickly slick, but masses of fun.<br><br><a href='https://www.bettycurse.co.uk' target='_blank'>www.bettycurse.co.uk</a>
