Yo Zushi takes to the stage in a suit resembling a cross between an old school comedian and a golfer, producing a charming set of beautiful love songs and stories, Yo Zushi?∆í√ôs smooth voice floating above the finely crafted bed of music. The set is pleasant if a little samey, in fact all a bit too nice, no grit, no balls, like a middle class Leonard Cohen. More ?∆í√öJolly Good?∆í√ô than soul searching stories of suffering.
