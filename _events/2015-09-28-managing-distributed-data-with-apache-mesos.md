Apache Mesos is a fantastic tool for abstracting CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual). Alongside these features is Mesos-DNS, which provides service discovery for all applications and services running in a Mesos cluster. These features combined lets you program against your datacenter like it's a single pool of resources, a useful tool when building highly scalable applications stacks.
