Whilst open sourcing a language is nothing new, Apple's unprecedented step has caused massive excitement and activity for this new language, with a flurry of development and contributions.

In this presentation I would like to explore the current potential of Swift and what's going to be possible in the future.

I will cover:

- What can be accomplished with 'open' Swift
- What's missing from 'open' Swift
- Back end Swift and MVC
- Swift on non-Mac desktops
- Swift on non-iOS mobile devices
- Extending Swift
- What's next?
