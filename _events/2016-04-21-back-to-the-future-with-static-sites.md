If you remember when web sites were all created with plain HTML pages, then you'll know that CMSs and dynamic web frameworks saved us and solved all our problems. Or did they? In fact, we instead spend a lot of time customising existing code to meet our requirements, grappling with deployments and then whacking caching on top of over-powered servers to get an ounce of speed.

Static Site Generators aim to sit somewhere in the middle and are perfect for semi-dynamic sites and with a little learning, better for content creators.

In this session, Chris will look at an overview of the principles and options for static site generators and deep dive into one or two to explain further how the work and can fit into your projects.
