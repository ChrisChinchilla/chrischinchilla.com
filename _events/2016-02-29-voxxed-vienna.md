We keep up to date with the latest developments in technologies and tools. We make sure to post pull requests to fix bugs we found in projects. We offer helpful advice in forums to people with coding questions. We propose talks for meetups and conferences to provide insight and inspiration.

All this on top of our day job.

When in the midst of all this activity do we stop to think about our mental or physical health?

The mental stress of sustained periods of high intellectual activity is draining and exhausting. The Physical impact of having such a sedentary job is becoming increasingly recognised. And all those caffeinated and sugar filled drinks we consume to keep going? Yeah, they're not that good for us either.

In this presentation I will look at quick tips to keep ourselves a little healthier whilst we do what we love. I'm not talking gruelling evenings huffing and puffing at the gym, but manageable and easy advice to whip you into shape.
