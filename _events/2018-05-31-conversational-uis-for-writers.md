Developers of voice and chat assistants are crying out for good writers to help them create the conversational interfaces of the present and future. In this talk, I will introduce what constitutes a 'good' conversational experience and how we, as writers, can benefit from this trend.

This will include advice on tone, variety of language, setting and checking user context, testing interfaces, presenting choice and much more.
