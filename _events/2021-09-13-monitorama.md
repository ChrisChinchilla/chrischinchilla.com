Documentation is notoriously difficult to measure and evaluate. If someone spends a long time on a page, is that good or bad? Is a high bounce rate a sign that people find what they need quickly, or not at all? Do readers use the "evaluate this document" polls to give your their opinion about what they read, or their frustrations with the product? This is not a talk about the meanings behind metrics, but rather a talk about how to construct Grafana dashboards from common documentation metrics sources to better help you (attempt to) draw some meaning out of the numbers.
