As programmers, designers, writers and those who pursue 'creative' pursuits we consider ourselves mostly immune to the predicted forthcoming robot invasion of our jobs.

But should we be so confident? A recent tool released to tell you the percentage chance of robots taking your job set the percentage at 89% for technical writers. Scary news.

In this presentation I will take a forward look at the ways that our roles may change and what we can do about it, covering topics such as:

-   Automatic writing and code generation.
-   Outsourcing and undercutting.
-   The 'devaluation' of programming knowledge.
-   New Luddites and the rejection of technology.

I promise to make you smile along the way üòÅ.
