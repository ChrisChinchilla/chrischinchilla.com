The battle between Google and Oracle may finally be over, but let's face it, the relationship between Android developers and Java is still a rocky one.

In this presentation I would like to look at the potential for Android development with a series of alternatives to Java, especially Go, Dart, Kotlin and Swift.

I will introduce the languages, analyze their potential and what is achievable with them, seeing if any of them are viable alternatives to the Java behemoth.
