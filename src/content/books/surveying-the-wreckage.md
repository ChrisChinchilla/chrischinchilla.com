Launched in August 2004, newmatilda.com is an Australian website of news, analysis and satire. After a brief break, it's back funded by donations from fans and subscribers. What better time for Ben Pobjie, one of its most infamous columnists, to survey the wreckage, pick up the pieces and reassemble the stories into something insightful, biting, humorous and as necessary as an esky on a steaming hot day.
