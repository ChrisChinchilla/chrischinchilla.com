Flashbang! is a collection of short fiction written during the February 2022 Flash Fiction February challenge hosted by the Storytelling Collective. Authors were given a daily prompt and encouraged to write whatever they felt inspired to writeâ€”as long as their stories were no longer than 500 words.

I had one story featured: Oath.
