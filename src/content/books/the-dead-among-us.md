What happens when the living and the previously dead fall in love?

Ten years after a long and brutal war, there is an uneasy peace between the living and the previously dead. Reluctantly reunited families, industries, and governments struggle to keep the world from falling back into bloody chaos.

Fate throws two couples together, and then the unexpected and assumed impossible happens, turning their lives and the world upside down.

“The dead among us” is a post-post-apocalyptic Thriller love story that shows that understanding can conquer history, resentment, and generational divides to create a new world.
