Whilst open sourcing a language is nothing new, there is no denying the popularity of Apple's new language and this has solidified with their recent move.

In this presentation I would like to explore the new projects created by and with Swift and see where this may lead in the future.

We will look at:

- What can be accomplished with 'open' Swift
- What's missing from 'open' Swift
- Back end Swift
- Swift on Linux
- Swift on Windows
- Will Swift on Android be possible
- What's next for Swift?
