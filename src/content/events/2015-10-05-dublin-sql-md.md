Using Crate a distributed database (Crate has a NoSQL base but is queried in SQL) as an explicit example Chris will show the theory and practice behind their component architecture, along with some basic but extremely cool queries to show what's possible with it. He will demonstrate the basic practicals of querying and coding for Crate using the gitHub archive.
