Automated processes and tools have been reading our content for some time, building humongous databases of our carefully crafted words so people can actually find them buried across the vast swathes of the internet.
And now, even more automated processes and machines are reading our content, packaging it into large models that make sense to few but bring sense to so many.

A lot of you listening and watching right now are probably afraid of what might happen to your job prospects over the coming years, and I am here to show you how, for the short term, your work will be more valuable than ever. Just maybe less directly to human consumers than before.
