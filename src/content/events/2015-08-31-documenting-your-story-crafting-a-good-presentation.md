Whilst not a part of the core documentation of projects, presentations and delivering them to the public are an essential part of spreading the word about what you do.

In this presentation I will explore and explain my experiences as an advocate for several open source projects, audience reactions to those presentations and how I have iterated my presentations in sync with changes to product and branding.
