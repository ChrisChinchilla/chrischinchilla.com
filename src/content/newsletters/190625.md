It was WWDC time, so this newsletter is unashamedly packed with Apple related news, but stay with meâ€¦ It's in-depth!

Personally I am looking forward to these "26" releases, but let's hope that unlike last year, Apple delivers. And maybe it was Apple trying to distract us, but I had a general feeling of people not caring too much about the lack of AI features, or that Apple resolved themselves to being the host and not always having to be the creator of said features.
