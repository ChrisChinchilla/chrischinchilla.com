It's nearly March 2025 and I am finally back with a Newsletter! Sorry about that 😬. I have been spending some time fixing up the toolchain behind the Newsletter as I intend to do more with it (and some new newsletters too) and wanted to build something that made it easier for me to get content together and keep a copy on my website. Anyway, back now, and with a fair backlog of content.
