It's nearly March 2025 and I am finally back with a Newsletter! Sorry about that ðŸ˜¬. I have been spending some time fixing up the toolchain behind the Newsletter as I intend to do more with it (and some new newsletters too) and wanted to build something that made it easier for me to get content together and keep a copy on my website. Anyway, back now, and with a fair backlog of content.

## Support this newsletter

If you like what you read here and want to keep supporting my work, I have a couple of ways you can support me this issue.
