Classic shows and services say goodbye and new approaches try something new.

_PS. For the older audience here I tried to get Firefly to generate a Chinchilla dressed like the video game character "[Magic Pockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Pockets)". But it had no idea what I was talking about. I'll give a free book to anyone who does send me that picture._
