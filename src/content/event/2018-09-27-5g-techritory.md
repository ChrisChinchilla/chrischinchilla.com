Chris and Cate attend high-level business and political discussions on 5G global deployment, including on how to turn visions into real business models, as well as the four key vertical markets which could have the biggest benefits from the introduction of 5G â€“ Smart City, Smart Mobility, Smart Healthcare and Industry 4.0. The Forum will also include the latest 5G technology presentations. A two-day agenda at the heart of the Baltics will bring together up to 1000 attendees - European policymakers, government officials, business leaders, investors, industry experts, start-ups and academic representatives, including 60+ senior speakers from Europe, Asia, and the USA.
