Backend/frontend developers, product owners, product managers, UX experts in Germany! If you're planning to participate in the Bosch ConnectedExperience (BCX) two-day Internet of Things (IoT) hackathon, then also mark your calendar to attend the “Investor Tea Time Pitch” which will be hosted by Robert Bosch Venture Capital. You'll get to see selected IoT startups pitch their projects to invited investors and then you'll also be able to network with those investors and startups.
