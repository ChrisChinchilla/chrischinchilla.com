Kauri is a ConsenSys spoke focussed on building a technical knowledge resource for the Ethereum ecosystem. I helped source writers to contribute content, edited their work, offered documentation support to projects, created technical writing training materials, and coordinated and mentored the community in better technical writing practices. _Kauri lost its funding in 2020 and is now archived_.
