Faria was founded in 2006 to transition schools off paper onto a curriculum-focused learning platform. Today they serve over 2,200 schools and over 550,000 students in 120 countries with a distributed team of 76 spread across 10 cities. I wrote and maintained their API documentation, user guides and the company internal documentation.
