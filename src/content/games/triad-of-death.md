Influential nobles have become consumed by the pursuit of mastering death. Uncovering three legendary artifacts—the Eye of Vecna, the Hand of Vecna, and the Wand of Orcus—they commission a skilled cabinet maker to create secure cabinets to hold the artifacts.

This is a short mystery adventure for 4-6 players at level 5, with a focus on social interaction and mystery solving, culminating in an epic climactic battle.
