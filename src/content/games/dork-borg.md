You are nerds, geeks, dorks, brainiacs. Whatever word you or (probably) someone else labels you with, you are deeply into something to the point of extremity.

Films, computers, books, transport, vinyl, musical instruments, 17th-century figurines, politics, comics. There's something you care about so much you'd be prepared to die to defend it.

Which is strange as that's exactly what's happening. For some inexplicable reason, you find yourself locked into a vast city-sized arena by some diabolical mind, assigned only one task. To survive.

Through strategy, skills, knowledge, running away and hiding, or boring your competition into stupefaction, you will face unknown obstacles, enemies, and maybe each other in a fearless, grim battle of Dork Borg!
