A short and possibly sweet piece of interactive fiction where you play a vampire deciding what to do for a night of entertainment. There is only one true answer, but hey, you have a bit agency. The game will be updated over time with more detail, content and Twine trickery, so watch those updates! Find the game on itch.io.
