Welcome to the village of Tempora, where time stands frozen in a delicate balance. As the adventurers arrive, they discover people and objects are suspended in motion, their lives frozen in a single instant.

This is a short adventure for 4-6 players at level 5, with a focus on puzzles and mystery solving, culminating in an epic climactic battle.
