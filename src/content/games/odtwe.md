This is an expanding universe I am using for short fiction, interactive fiction, a roleplay game, and a card game.

-   Find the Roleplay game on [itch.io](https://chrischinchilla.itch.io/one-day-the-world-ended) and [it's own website](https://onedaytheworldended.com/).
-   Short stories exist, but they need a new home, watch this space.
