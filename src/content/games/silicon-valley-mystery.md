You are detectives tasked with solving a mystery quicker than any other player. Whoever scores the most points is declared the winner. You gain more points for gaining clues when they are newer (called “freshness”), as opposed to gaining as many clues as possible.

Silicon Valley Mystery comes with a handful of pre-written mysteries to solve based in Silicon Valley, but there are resources available to create your own scenarios for others to play.
