Many years ago, on the summer solstice, a great hero performed magnificent acts of selfless charity, and earned the blessings of the gods.

To honor this memory, each summer solstice, pilgrims travel far and wide to visit ten temples dedicated to the Norse Gods, and engage in acts of charity, each according their own ability, with hopes of gaining the blessings of the gods.

The locals however, use this as an excuse to exploit gullible pilgrims and worshippers and try to get their dirty work done for free.
