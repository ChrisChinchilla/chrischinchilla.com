Dungeon Masters of the world, have you ever thrown a dragon at your party and found the resulting combat to be repetitive slugfest? Has your game of Dungeons & Dragons been reduced to a dull series of dice rolls resulting in "Hit" or "Miss"? Or conversely, is your dragon way too powerful, forcing you to make it weaker or risk a TPK? Would you like to spice up your dragon encounters with a little more personality? Would you like your dragons to be long-term threats whose actions have far-reaching consequences? Would you like to give your players more choices in what they want to do?
