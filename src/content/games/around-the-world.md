Welcome adventurers! Today, you find yourselves in the bustling and ornate lobby of the Cartographers Guild.

You have been challenged to journey through remote places on the far corners of the map and return within 80 days bearing souvenirs originating from these places.

This is a short 3 hour adventure for 4-6 players at level 3, with a focus on exploration, resource management, travel planning and social dynamics.
