In the frigid heart of Icewind Dale, a distress call has been heard from a mining expedition sent to the outpost of Inflection Point. But this is no ordinary cry for help â€“ it originates from the shattered remnants of a once-soaring castle that now lies broken and buried in the snow. Within its frozen depths, an elder mindflayer conducts grotesque experiments, melding aberration biology with creatures of the North, creating hybrid abominations that defy the natural order.
