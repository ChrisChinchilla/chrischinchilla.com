-   Creating and maintaining tests, screenshot generation, and other documentation tools
-   Editing and reviewing submissions from internal and external contributors
-   Liaising and working with our developer relations and marketing teams for collaboration ideas
-   Responsibility for metrics, planning, and delivery of documentation
