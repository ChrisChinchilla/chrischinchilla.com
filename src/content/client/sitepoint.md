SitePoint is a hub for web developers to share their passion for building incredible Internet things. Founded by Mark Harbottle and Matt Mickiewicz in 1999, SitePoint is for web professionals, by web professionals: developers, designers, programmers, product creators and entrepreneurs alike. I worked as a writer, reviewer and editor of the mobile channel for three years.
