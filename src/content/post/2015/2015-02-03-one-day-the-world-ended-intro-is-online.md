After some polishing, planning and technical tweaking the text version of my work of fiction is now online.

This introduction aims to set the ground for the two main sections of the story, before the end of the world and what happens next. Each section is comprised of several parts and each of these could be stories that branch off in the future.

Enjoy reading what's there right now and there will be more to follow soon.
