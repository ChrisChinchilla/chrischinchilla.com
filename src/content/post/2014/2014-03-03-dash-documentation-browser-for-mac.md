Every now and then along comes a piece of software that just does pretty much everything right, one of these is Dash.

Ok, it's a documentation browser for developers, so has a limited appeal, but it's makers have really thought through a lot of it's configuration and layout. Why would you need this? Can't you just go online for documentation? Well, yes you can, but sometimes you're not online and if you're like me, sometimes you just like an app.

Why is it awesome?<ul><li>It has heaps of documentation sets (that I need) including PHP, Drupal, MySQL, CSS, Twig, Smarty and many more.</li><li>It integrates with heaps of other tools in my workflow such as Alfred, Sublime, XCode and many more, allowing for instant lookup to functions.</li><li>It has a great layout that can be switched between a standard app and a HUD style display.</li><li>Alongside searching any documentation you've downloaded it also searches Google and Stack Overflow for your query.</li><li>It doesn't bug you to pay for an unlocker, but if you love the app (and I do) it's only $20.</li></ul>

It's simple, but so well executed.
