I have just rolled it the first incarnation of <a href="https://theleantraveller.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Traveller</a>, with the first of the topics we will be covering, '<a href="https://theleantraveller.com/money" target="_blank">Money</a>'.

We have the beginnings of a theme and structure, but there's much more to come in the next month:<ul><li>Adding images</li><li>Ratings and Cost comparisons</li><li>More Content</li><li>Project Management workflow behind the scenes for handling contacting services we cover.</li><li>More topics and content</li></ul>

This was a reasonably easy initial rollout, the only complications being that we are utilising Drupal's<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/domain" target="_blank"> Domain module</a> to handle centralising content amongst all our project sites whilst also feeding it out to the appropriate project site. This has required some fiddling, but we have got there now!
