I've been following the musical exploits of Ben and Chris for a fair few years as they morphed from their old band (Tempertwig) to this new two-piece. Unlike other two pieces Nosferatu D2 don't rely on heavy overdrive, effects or production to pad out the sound, just the same guitar sound all the way through, one vocal and some of the most amazing frantic drumming I've ever heard. Lyrically it's dark stuff, rejection, being let down, laments to lost youth and scathing commentaries on suburban life all delivered with a dry cynical wit. Not an album to listen to if you want cheering up, but for great musicianship and lyrical brilliance this is the place.
