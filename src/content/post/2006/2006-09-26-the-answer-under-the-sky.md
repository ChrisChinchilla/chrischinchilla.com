The Answer, for some reason, sounded like they were going to be a mod band, I should imagine that if the Answer ever met a Mod band, a fight would probably ensue, being a Heavy blues rock act of the finest order. Not usually my cup of tea, but they;re so damn good at it with poodle perms, riffs aplenty, reverb soaked vocals and solos all over the shop, in fact everything you could want out of a good old fashioned slice of Rock and Roll action.
