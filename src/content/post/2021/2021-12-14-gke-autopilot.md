As big Kubernetes users ourselves, we know that one of the best ways to run Kubernetes is to use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Earlier this year, Google Cloud announced a new mode for running GKE called Autopilot. Google Cloud designed Autopilot to reduce the operational cost of managing clusters, optimize clusters for production, and yield higher workload availability. Autopilot takes a lot of the legwork and complexity out of managing Kubernetes clusters, saving you time and money. But, like all critical infrastructure, you still need a plan for monitoring and observability for the cluster. Thatâ€™s where Chronosphere comes in.
