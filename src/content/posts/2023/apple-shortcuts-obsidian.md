  I’ve mentioned before that I have been using Obsidian more and more, and from
  a knowledge management perspective, it’s fantastic, with a plethora of plugins
  that extend its functionality to connect to many external services. But as a
  cross-platform Electron application, integration with the host operating
  system is one of the places it fails. As the underlying data store is a folder
  of files, some integration is possible there, but Obsidian has minimal
  awareness of changes that happen.
