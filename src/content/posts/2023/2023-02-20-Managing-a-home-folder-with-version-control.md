Some time ago, [I mentioned a process I tried](https://medium.com/geekculture/migrating-applications-and-data-to-a-new-mac-without-using-time-machine-240e1de77892)that allowed me to partially recreate my Mac setup on
another machine with scripts. As part of that process I attempted to add
my home folder configuration to version control so that I could keep
track of changes to it, and again, use it on other devices if needed.

To accomplish this, I made use of three tools mostly, plus several
symbolic links and aliases.
