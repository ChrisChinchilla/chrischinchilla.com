I finally finished my first fiction novel after two years of work and have already begun work on my second. I’ve also produced several short stories and have some game supplements in slow progress.
So, as people seem interested in knowing these things, I thought it was about time I shared my setup for creative writing. I specify “creative writing” as I have different tool chains for my different writing activities. You can read more about those in future posts.
