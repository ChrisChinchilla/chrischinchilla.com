Or how Google IO made me realise I probably need to find a new job in 2 years

Squeezed into the remodelled Google Berlin old medical school theatre I have a lovely glass of wine ready to go as I attempt to live blog a keynote for the first time in a while. I love watching American keynotes with Europeans, as we are much more… sceptical. One person in the crowd cheered for an announcement once and everyone looked at them like they were crazy.

OK, this is all pretty unstructured as I don’t have time to construct a full blog post right now. here we go!
