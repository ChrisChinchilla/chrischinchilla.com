I didn’t attend Detroit last year, but did attend Valencia, and while it was great to be back at a reasonably large in-person event again, the event did feel slightly subdued.
I worried that the past few months of leaner times and layoffs for the tech industry might mean that this year’s KubeCon EU might also feel muted for different reasons. I couldn’t be more wrong.
I admit that my memory of pre-2020 EU KubeCons (and I’ve been to most of them) is a little hazy, but this year in Amsterdam felt like the biggest and liveliest I’ve attended.
