I have stuffed so much into [my website](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/chrischinchilla.com) over the years it was starting to creak
at the seams. For most of its life, at least the life I can remember, I
used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). When
the life of this website began, Jekyll was still fairly new and my mind
was blown by static site generators (I probably migrated from Drupal,
which was my thing back in the early 2000s). When I reworked it a couple
of years ago, I considered other options but ended up settling back to
what I already knew well.

In honesty, Jekyll still works fine for my needs, but a combination of
Apple Silicon breaking my ageing custom gems and wanting an excuse to
try the wave of new "cool" content frameworks, I thought it was time to
overhaul.
