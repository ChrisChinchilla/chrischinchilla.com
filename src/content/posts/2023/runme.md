summary: >-
  Markdown may be popular for its simplicity and “plainness”, but it’s often
  full of information. Whether for internal or external consumption, that
  information often contains code snippets for running certain commands or code
  examples. Wouldn’t it be great if you could run that code directly as you read
  from within the markdown?
