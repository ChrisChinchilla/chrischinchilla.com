summary: >-
  As is usual from my blog posts, this may or may not grow as I remember
  things&hellip;<ul><li>The visual discrepancy between rich and poor in San
  Francisco is extremely stark<ul><li>Add to that, the gap between white/Asian
  and black/Latino is even more noticeable.</li></ul></li><li>A lot of the
  Not-For-Profit sector seems obsessed with money and how to make
  it.</li><li>The tipping culture is weird&hellip; In that people don&#39;t tip
  because they want to, but because they feel obliged to. Which makes tipping
  and the divvying up of bills an awkward and bizarrely scientific process to
  watch.</li><li>Americans table manners, especially the way they treat servers,
  are peculiar&hellip; Perhaps related to above.</li><li>Sales people very open
  and friendly, I assume because they want to sell you something. On the other
  hand, Customer service, especially civil service, quite unforgiving and
  unhelpful.</li><li>A lot of things in Australia aren&#39;t as expensive as
  people think. Especially food and fuel.</li><li>Conferences in Australia are a
  lot more multi-cultural, with more people from overseas and we&#39;re more
  interested in those from overseas.</li></ul>
