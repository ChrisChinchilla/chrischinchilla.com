Here's a quote/analogy I've been using for a while to overarchingly describe a strategy for engaging on social media that I've found helpful and descriptive.

> If you walk into a bar and all you do is stand on the bar, screaming and shouting about yourself, would you expect anyone to engage with you? It's the same with social media…
