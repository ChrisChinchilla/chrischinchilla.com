One of the challenges of my new attempt to blog about all the events I attend is that some events are hard to write about there and then on the spot. Networking events being one of them, you can't keep whipping out a notebook/tablet to jot down conversations and, well, you may not find anything you want to write about.

Still, a challenge is a challenge…

Silicon Beach has been running for quite a while and despite a declining audience due to many other similar events now and their decision to cut sponsored bar (see my <a href="https://blog.thefetch.com/2013/08/03/the-golden-rules-of-meetup-etiquette/" target="_blank">Fetch post on Meetup etiquette</a> folks!), however they are still running with attendance enviable to most groups and some would say, better quality audiences now.

Who did I meet… Well.

A Telstra project manager who gave me some insights into their recent profit reports…

Some folks from <a href="https://www.edenexchange.com/" target="_blank">edenexchange.com</a> an entrepreneurs and funding marketplace.

An Investment Analyst from Australian Super. This isn't the first time I've met someone from 'old school' financial advice at a startup event, interesting to see the space becoming far more mainstream.

Some folks from <a href="https://www.appster.com.au/" target="_blank">Appster</a> a mobile application development company. We talked development techniques and hoping to get someone for a future <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Melbournemobile" target="_blank">Melbourne Mobile</a> session.
