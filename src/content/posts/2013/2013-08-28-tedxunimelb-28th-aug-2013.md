The <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx" target="_blank">tedx</a> model is a slightly strange one, fraught with as many positives as negatives for organisers, however it does create a fascinating ecosystem around the world. Tonight had a packed room, but was unfortunately fraught with technical issues and joins several other local tedx events around Melbourne.

**Viv Benjamin, Oaktree foundation**

The nerd in me thought it was nice to hear a reference to the original meaning  of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>'. This was a sobering but inspiring presentation around issues of poverty,  injustice but also robbing people of identity and their respect. Viv managed to encourage all attendees to stand and participate in a clap of agreement on ending global poverty. A reminder that Kevin Rudd signed on to end global poverty, unyet we are cutting aid budgets. Despite how we may all feel, we are actually on target, cutting global poverty five years early (target was 2020), I would be interested to know how this is defined as a target. Be proud to solve world problems and be able to tell the generation after you that you were part of it.

**Tom Amos, Sidekicker**

A good follow up talk about prompting yourself to ask yourself "am I following my passion?" and not just saying you are living your dream. After deciding he was too lazy to be a professional golfer, Tom became an accountant before starting SideKicker. His talk had a subtext of agile and lean thinking without using the actual jargon. His advice is doing what you love and ignoring the haters and people who give you bad advice, if you want recognition and don't notice the time you are putting in, you're probably doing what you love. Second piece of advice is to work with great people and people you like. Don't just fail, but look at why you failed, otherwise you're wasting time.

Then I left in the Interval, sorry!
