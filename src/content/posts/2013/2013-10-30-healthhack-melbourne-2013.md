summary: >-
  <p class="p1">I feel slightly cheeky writing much about the event as I
  didn&rsquo;t really end up doing very much and felt somewhat humbled and
  embarrassed by the other attendees.<p class="p1">Anyway, to start at the
  beginning.<p class="p1">HealthHack 2013 was a weekend hackfest solving
  problems that medical researchers face. HealthHack brought together medical
  researchers, bioinformaticians, software developers, data analysts, data
  visualisers and designers. Together, they created new software tools to
  analyse, visualise and communicate data.<p class="p1">Organised by a great
  team in a very welcoming atmosphere it was a surprisingly well attended event
  considering the niche topic.&nbsp;Read about the weekend and the winners here
  - <span class="s2"><a
  href="https://healthhackmelb.com">healthhackmelb.com</a><p class="p1">I turned
  up on Friday night and enjoyed being very well fed and watered and finally got
  to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/FCTweedie"><span
  class="s2">@FCTweedie</a> in the flesh after much mutual twitter stalking.<p
  class="p1">I listened to the problem statements and must admit it was all a
  little over my head. I come from a technical background and despite having
  studied &lsquo;proper programming&rsquo; at University it has been a very long
  time since I really did any and I realise my web work is very light really.
  Also the technical scientific nature of the problems was a little out of my
  depth, I vaguely understand what things like DNA are, but when it comes to
  reporting, analysing and visualising them, way out of my comfort zone.<p
  class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Still, I found one talk spoke
  to me at a level I could understand, which was about visualising the quality
  of academic papers on particular subjects. Working a lot within content
  management systems, this seemed like an ideal fit to my skills, so I joined
  the team. However, mixing with a bunch of far superior programmers to me, it
  was immediately obvious that they had far more complex (and probably more
  appropriate) solutions in mind and I was a little lost again&hellip;<p
  class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">I meandered around for a bit
  watching what people where up to and went to see if the organisers needed any
  help, they didn&rsquo;t, but were incredibly nice to me about everything and
  we had a very interesting chat about Hack events in general, but I think
  that&rsquo;s a discussion for another blog post.<p class="p1"><span
  style="line-height: 1.538em;">Great stuff and congratulations to all involved.
