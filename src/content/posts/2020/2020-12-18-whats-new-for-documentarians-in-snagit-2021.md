I ran a live stream a while back where I looked at new features in
Snagit 2021 and how they can help those writing technical documentation
or explanatory content generate great screenshots. And then I had a
deadline, another deadline, and all sorts of other chaos, and somehow I
only got around the blog post to accompany that livestream... now. Well,
on the positive, in the meantime, I have had much more time to get my
hands on Snagit 2021 in a real-world context. So, if you need to create,
edit, and manage screenshots, how can Snagit 2021 help you?
