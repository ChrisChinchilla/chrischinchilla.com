summary: >-
  Despite sounding similar, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment are
  subtly different from each other. While they have overlap, they are applicable
  and useful at different stages of the development process. In this post, we
  look at what the different terms mean, what benefits they bring to you and
  your team, and what you need to get started implementing the practice.
