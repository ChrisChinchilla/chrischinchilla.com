summary: >-
  Nestled amongst the headliners gear Simon Breed (and the Birthmarks) makes a
  3-piece sound like anything from a 5 piece with full brass section to a lone
  voice. Captivating songs including obscenities aimed at problem bosses to
  beautiful ditties about Brotherly Love, Simon Breed takes the image of a man
  with an acoustic guitar and fucks it right up.
