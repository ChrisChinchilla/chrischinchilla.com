summary: >-
  Whilst I do not believe in God by any means and would certainly describe
  myself as an Atheist, my biggest issue with 'The God Delusion' is what Richard
  Dawkins would describe as his 'Devout Atheism'. The fervour and passion he
  writes with is almost on a par with that of a religion devotees and thus at
  times is equally as awkward to digest. Perhaps it could also be due to a
  conditioning of our modern world he describes, in that we feel awkward
  discussing religious topics in public, in case we offend someone around us,
  even when reading the book I found myself occasionally hiding the title in
  front of possible 'religious types' in case I offended them. The book is
  generally easy to read and full of intriguing, interesting and thought
  provoking topics and nuggets of information only occasionally wandering into
  intellectual territory that may be lost on some readers.
