summary: >-
  Perhaps the closest reference point to Douglas Coupland for those of you
  unfamiliar with his work is Kurt Vonnegut, a reference point that I'm sure
  Douglas Coupland hears frequently. If you're unfamiliar with either's work
  then I guess the best description would be, 'different' or maybe 'hyper real',
  characters sort of shamble through in a state of confusion that no one else
  suffers from with odd occurrences happening to them that no one else considers
  odd. JPod is a book about and aimed at Geeks, there are a lot of references in
  the text to computers, Geek culture and attitudes that may be lost on those
  unfamiliar with them, whilst this wont detract from the plot, Jokes will
  certainly be missed. JPod also makes a habit of inserting lots of random pages
  into the book, some relevant, some a complete waste of tree, for example over
  60 pages filled with numbers involved in games that the characters play with
  each other whilst at work, a nice character building device, but a waste of
  paper. A funny and easy read (this took me a week and I don't have a lot of
  time to read in my life) full of accurate and amusing observations, but one
  that will be lost on many people.
