  A bitterly cold winter's Sunday is a hard night to stage a gig and expect a
  crowd to venture out into the wild winds. However Manchester Lane seems to be
  everyone's perfect choice to evade the inclement weather outside, there is a
  constant to-ing and fro-ing of waiting staff from the Kitchen, the bar is busy
  with clanking glasses and the venue is nigh on full with an enthusiastic and
  appreciative audience chatting in these highly civilised surrounds. Laura Jean
  and the Eden Land Band more appear on stage quietly and collectively than take
  to it, a motley collective of bass, drums, violin, clarinet and a pair of legs
  dangling behind the stage's vast grand piano. Despite Laura's protestations to
  life being hard as a 'Folk' musician and quips about confidence issues,
  (apparently unbeknown to her) she has the room in the palm of her hands, with
  all sat staring at her attentively, hanging on to every breathy vocal, every
  luscious intertwining melody and haunting hook. The set is a hypnotic series
  of beautiful arrangements, crescendos rising, harmonies building and falling,
  a seemingly complex patchwork of brilliantly played instruments by permanently
  bemused but skilled musicians.<br>Pikelet is and has always been hard to
  place, her solo shows can take some getting used to, as she sets up songs and
  builds to sometimes ear splittingly layered musical peaks through an ingenious
  combination of gadgets and dusty old instruments. The thought of her with a
  backing band is a tempting one, an opportunity to take her involved
  arrangements and spread them out between other musicians, leading to more
  spacious and fluid songs. However her backing band tonight is not the
  anticipated stage full of people with a plethora of instruments but two lanky
  fellows, one on a drum kit of sorts and the other behind an increasing array
  of gizmos, instruments and sounds. When the 'band' takes the opportunity to
  really kick in suddenly Pikelet's songs come vibrantly alive with a renewed
  groove and freshness that can only be added by a gang of musicians gelling
  toether. These opportunities are few with the majority of the set simply
  Pikelet, her intriguing methods of accompanying herself and her strange stage
  manner. The moments when she is most engaging and her talent for witty
  melodies really shines through are when it really is just her, a powerful solo
  voice, a solo instrument, her unique phrasing and her eccentrically haunting
  songs.
