summary: >-
  The prester quest is a story of two men's present day retracing of a journey
  from Italy to Ethiopia made by a Papal Emissary in 1177. His mission to
  deliver a letter to a supposedly (and widely believed to be) real King of a
  fantastical Christian land in the heart of Islamic lands. I read a similar
  'retracing the steps' book (Victoria Clarks, The Wayfarers) about a year ago,
  which was an amazing read, so this book had a lot to live up to. It starts
  slowly and doesn't really get going until about a quarter of a way through the
  book, the author's slightly facetious tone initially rather annoying and
  patronizing. However once the plot and journey kicks in the book is a gripping
  read full of interesting facts, observations and experiences from History and
  their eventful journey across several countries, continents and cultures.
