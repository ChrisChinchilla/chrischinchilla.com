The old paradigms in software design have been on life support for a long time.

Who under 30 can relate to the metaphors many interfaces are based upon: desktops, folders, files, disk icons and cutting and pasting with scissors and glue brushes?

Who in their life has ever kept a file inside a folder, inside a folder, inside another folder? I can't even imagine what that would look like.
