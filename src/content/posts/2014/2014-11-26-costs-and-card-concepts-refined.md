Just a small update, with a much larger one coming next week.

I have updated and refined the [costs](/manual/costs) and [card](/manual/cards) concepts of the game. I have also started drafting a manual which ties together the game into a sort or logic and creating the system that I will use (and the public in the future) to create cards.

All of that will be reported back on next week!
