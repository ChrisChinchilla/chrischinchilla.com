  <p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">A strange session tonight as
  we had a last minute cancellation, this coupled with the typical business
  session audience, i.e. High RSVP, high no-show, meant it was a quiet and quick
  evening.<p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Andrew Skinner
  confessed to not being a confident public speaker, however this didn&#39;t
  detract from his high quality, high content presentation. The presentation
  covered getting client / internal team buy in for developing apps and Andrew
  drew from his years of experience working with some high profile clients and
  projects. His practical take homes was an explanation of Business canvases for
  developing business models and how to use them.<br /><em><span

  style="line-height: 1.538em;">Cameron Burns took a very different approach,
  being from a marketing background, throwing away his planned talk and just
  seeing what the audience were interested in. He covered sources of funding,
  choices of development stacks, using remote development teams, marketing plans
  for your apps and much much more in a quick fire sequence of tips and
  advice.<br /><em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Connect with Cameron via
