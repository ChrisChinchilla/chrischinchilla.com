summary: >-
  \#UNIT runs regular meetups in Berlin aimed at those working in tech who
  identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex (LBGTI), but
  with an overarching message of providing a space for speakers who you might
  not always see at more mainstream events. I personally don’t identify as any
  of these, but I always enjoy the diverse messages and fun atmosphere I hear at
  the meetups, and this was my second time attending the yearly conference.
