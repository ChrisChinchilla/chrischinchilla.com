I am standing inside the exhibitor room of (what claims to be) Eastern
Europe's largest startup event, [IT
Arena](https://itarena.ua/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://itarena.ua/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in Lviv,
Ukraine. All around me are booths of companies looking for developers to
join them, many servicing overseas clients. Upstairs are a handful of
scrappy local entrepreneurs explaining their ideas, generally, they are
well executed, but early stage. IT Arena has great talks happening
around us, attracting speakers from all over the globe with an
impressive selection of technical, product and business topics. Despite
this, a recurring thread running through the talks and conversations I
had with attendees was that Ukraine wasn't terribly good (yet) at the
startup game. As a fan of highlighting newer startup and tech scenes (I
will stick to 'startup' for the rest of this article), I wanted to know
and understand why?
