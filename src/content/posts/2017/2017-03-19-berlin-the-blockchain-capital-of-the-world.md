summary: >-
  With the UK exiting the European Union, Germany is jostling to become the new
  FinTech capital of the EU. Frankfurt has the history and established finance
  industry, but Berlin is more affordable, is larger, and has a more diverse
  population, looking at challenges from different perspectives. With at least
  six regular blockchain and cryptocurrency related meetups, founding members of
  Ethereum and Monax present in the city, and countless cryptocurrency related
  projects, analysts are beginning to call Berlin “the blockchain capital of the
  world.” As this year’s FinTech Safary threw the doors of organization and
  co-working spaces open, I met with a small selection of people involved in the
  scene to see how true this claim is.
