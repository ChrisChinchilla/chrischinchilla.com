summary: >-
  I listen to hours of developer-focused podcasts each week covering tech,
  current affairs, board games, and general geekery. I even started my own
  podcast, which I have a lot of fun making. Hundreds of developers have written
  blog posts recommending thousands of different podcast series. There's no
  shortage of such recommendations for software engineers, so I won't subject
  you to another one of those lists. Instead, I'll idenfity specific podcast
  episodes that I think nailed a particular topic and were extremely engaging
  and fascinating from a developer's or technologist's perspective. For some of
  them, the interview subject or guest was especially interesting, or a
  discussion cropped up that was really compelling. For some reason, these
  episodes were very memorable, and that's why I think each one is worth your
  time.
