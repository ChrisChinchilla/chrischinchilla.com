summary: >-
  Stack Overflow's 2017 developer survey crossed my desk at the same time as a
  report on tech wage trends from Dice.com, who I’d never heard of before, but
  the report echoed many of my own observations, so I read further. It’s only
  from US data, but again, I have seen similar trends in other countries, so
  thought I’d share insights with you, in case, you know, you’re looking for a
  change, or are inquisitive about your worth.
