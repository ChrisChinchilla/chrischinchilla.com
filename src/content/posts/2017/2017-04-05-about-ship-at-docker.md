summary: >-
  I have been a Docker fan since almost day 1, working for a company that
  packaged its project to work in containers early-on, writing many blog posts
  on usage and related tooling, attending meetups here in Berlin and
  contributing to two code sprints as a mentor. Late last year I gave a talk at
  LinuxCon in Berlin to see Solomon Hykes (Founder) sat in the front row, a
  nerve-racking delight.
