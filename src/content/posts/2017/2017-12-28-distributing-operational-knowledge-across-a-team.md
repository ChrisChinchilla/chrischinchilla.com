summary: >-
  I am sure we have all worked (or work) for companies, teams, or clients where
  communication of internal information is somewhere on the scale between
  nonexistent and abysmal. Despite constant advances in information storage and
  communication technology, I’m sure many of you would agree that we are still
  not any better at communicating with each other. In this post, I will discuss
  some tooling options to consider, but more important, cover when, why, and how
  to use them.
