summary: >-
  Two experiences in my life have shaped the way I try to talk about technology.
  One was over ten years ago when I taught a room full of retirees, long-term
  unemployed, and recent immigrants basic computer skills. I realized that I
  could throw many of the subjects I had studied out of the window and that the
  best way to teach people was to give them a reason to learn. Fast forward to
  last year (and a subject I wrote previously on SitePoint) when I taught
  programming to a group of recent Syrian refugees. Again, I had to throw away
  much of my own learning and preconceptions and think afresh.
