summary: >-
  InterPlanetary File System, also known as IPFS, is a peer to peer media
  protocol that means to make the web faster, safer, and open sourced. Right now
  we're in need of a system that has fast performance, continuous access to
  content, efficient data transfer, easy naming conventions, and low cost.
  Although IPFS is in its early stages, it can do all of these things.
