---

Slightly late on my yearly roundup, which was the catchphrase of the
year for me. I'm not quite sure where 2018 went, to be honest, I had so
many plans, then it was halfway through the year, then it was over. One
of my resolutions for 2019 is to make sure I have more time for personal
and creative projects. Which I think I also said last year üò≠.

All in all, it was a good year, and I worked for a lot of interesting
projects, which explains the lack of time. I travelled a little too
much, but visited interesting places, and met interesting people. I was
disappointed in myself for not finishing some of my creative projects,
and am doubling down to complete a few more in 2019.

As part of this plan, I am rebranding and rejigging what I do. This
includes:

- [Switching my Gregarious Mammal presence to be a pure tech writing
  agency, and no longer use it as my creative vehicle.]{#a168}
- [My Chris Chinchilla presence will be reborn as my hub for creative
  projects, talks, blogs with my name on, and podcasts.]{#d89f}

Speaking of podcasts, I am shuttering the Gregarious Mammal podcast and
splitting into some new shows:

- [Bringing back the weekly squeak news show that will tie tightly
  with my weekly newsletter.]{#87be}
- [Starting two new shows, one called "The Enthusiastic Amateur", one
  based on "The Boardgame Jerk" bot I have.]{#9b98}
- [The Write the Docs show will continue and I may merge some of the
  interviews into a DZone podcast.]{#b70f}

My newsletter will assume it's regular weekly schedule inline with the
podcast, and I am also launching two new automated newsletters:

- [One covering Tech Ethics with Nicholas Borsotto.]{#240b}
- [One covering "language", NLP, voice interfaces, interactive fiction
  and more.]{#8add}

My planned creative projects are:

- [A book on improving tech.]{#b902}
- [Expanding the Boardgame Jerk bot.]{#3878}
- [A Geek vs. Geek card game.]{#319f}
- [An anonymous blog. I can't tell you what it is, as that would spoil
  things üòÅ.]{#27a0}
- [One shot RPG scenarios based on my "One Day the World Ended"
  project.]{#46dc}
- [Finishing the "One Day the World Ended" card game, that will tie
  into the RPG.]{#aa57}
- [A bunch of other interactive fiction wotsits.]{#8ee9}

Oh, and a whole set of open source contributions of course.

But what happened in 2018 ü§î?

### Writing {#faf8 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="faf8"}

In 2018, I wrote approximately **74** articles, blog posts, and
tutorials. In addition to this I contributed documentation to IPFS,
Solidity, Plasma MVP, Vale, Event Store, Facebook Messenger, and
probably a bunch more I've forgotten.

### Video and¬†audio {#95dc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="95dc"}

I created **62** podcast episodes, and the most popular were:

- [[Stefan Thomas, ripple and Malta blockchain
  summit](https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1vp20){.markup--anchor
  .markup--li-anchor
  data-href="https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1vp20"

Proving that Blockchain people love podcasts!

I created a video course for Manning called "[CSS in
Depth](https://livevideo.manning.com/course/25/css-in-depth-in-motion){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://livevideo.manning.com/course/25/css-in-depth-in-motion"
rel="noopener" target="\_blank"}", which took a lot of work!

### Presentations and Conferences {#e4fc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="e4fc"}

I spoke at, or reported on approximately **40** conferences and meetups,
not including the roughly 2 a week I attend in Berlin on a regular
basis.

**According to Google (including personal travel) this included 26
airports, 267 places, 50 cities and 17 countries. Just over 100,000km.**

That was a little too many, and in 2019 I am going to be more focused on
which events I attend.
