summary: >-
  The Opera Web browser, first introduced 30 years ago, has over its long tenure helped to pioneer features that would later become commonplace among all Web browsers—including tabs, sync, and built-in search. Opera was among the first to introduce a built-in AI assistant (Aria) as well as the ability to use locally running models with its developer version. Now, Opera aims to be the first to offer a new kind of AI agent–based browsing, with a feature called Browser Operator.
