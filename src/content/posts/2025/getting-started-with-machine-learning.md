summary: >-
  Machine Learning requires vast amounts of resources, and distributing these resources across multiple devices and regions helps with cost, speed, and data sovereignty. Bacalhau is an open-source distributed orchestration framework designed to bring compute resources to the data where and when you want, drastically reducing latency and resource overhead.
  
  Instead of moving large datasets around networks, Bacalhau makes it easy to execute jobs close to the dataâ€™s location, reducing latency and resource overhead.
