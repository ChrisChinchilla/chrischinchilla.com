summary: >-
  The move to the cloud promised to save users money and give them insights into their usage and costs.

  However, the opposite happened. A 2025 report from AAG stated that around 82% of respondents found cloud spending challenging. A cloudzero report from 2024 states that more than 20% of respondents had no clear idea of their cloud costs, with reports for large users sometimes consisting of thousands of rows of hard-to-read usage data.
