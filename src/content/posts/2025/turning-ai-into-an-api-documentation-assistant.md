summary: >-
  API documentation is generally predictable, follows common patterns, and is one of the least interesting tasks in a documentation project. It's also a task with a degree of pre-existing automatic generation tools and practices.
  
  It sounds like a perfect use case for AI-assistive tools!
  
  In this post, I look at general and specialized tools for generating API documentation from code and text-based prompts. I also cover potential problems and pitfalls in generated docs and how to test the generated output to ensure its accuracy.
