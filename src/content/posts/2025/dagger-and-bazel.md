summary: >-
  For those of you in the Bazel ecosystem, when you hear "Dagger", you probably think of the dependency injection framework for Java, Kotlin, and Android. And for good reason. Dependencies are frequently part of a build process. But there's another Dagger in the wild, a tool and platform for ephemerally building and testing multi-language projects. Sound familiar?
  
  In this post, I look at what (the new) Dagger is, how it works, and how it compares to Bazel.
