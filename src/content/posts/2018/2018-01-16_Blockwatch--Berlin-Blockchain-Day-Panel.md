On a cold Friday December night, with a Christmas market buzzing
outside, a small group of Blockchain enthusiasts gathered for a 'day'
(actually an afternoon) of discussions with luminaries from the
community organized by [Binary
District](https://binarydistrict.com/about/){.markup--anchor

rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, a new global education center. As is
traditional for events in Berlin, the time of year had thrown well-made
plans into disruption, and the organizers have asked me to host a panel
between all the speakers.

On the panel are [Alexander

[Alexander Chepurnoy](http://chepurnoy.org/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://chepurnoy.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} (Developer), and [Vlad
Zamfir](https://twitter.com/VladZamfir){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/VladZamfir"

digging into how enthusiastic developers take their ideas into reality
with smart contracts and 'traditional' programming languages and
infrastructure.

I wouldn't say all my questions were exactly answered, but it was an
interesting panel nonetheless. Enjoy!
