Developers are building many different types of experiences in
Messenger, and while messaging is at the core of a bot's architecture,
the Messenger webview provides devs with the flexibility to incorporate
elements of their webpage experience into their app. Whether you're
looking to add a checkout flow, share a new product page, or simply
distribute content, the webview opens up a world of possibilities to
create richer interactions.
