As part of creating Chip Shop (and future game ideas) I read recommendations on reading about (and playing) various types of games, not just board games.

I'll admit that I have generally sucked at modern computer games, but I am still amazed by the storytelling, ideas and visuals in them.

This book was an amazing journey for me, an excuse and way of exploring games that I will likely never be able to play or will be too incompetent to enjoy. It covers classics to modern games, obscure to massive successes and everything in-between.

A highly recommended read for anyone into storytelling of any kind.
