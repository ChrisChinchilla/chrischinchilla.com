This week I have added rules to the '[Playing the Game](/manual/playing-game)' section of the manual to cover the following:

- How and when products pass from being private in a player's factory to being public in the general playing area.
- What happens when players run out of certain resources.

I added a [game concept to cover accessories](/content/accessory) (keyboards, mice etc).

Finally, I am speaking at the Berlin Game Scene's <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BerlinGameScene/events/220863773/" target="_blank">Talk & Play event next week</a> about Chip Shop, so I have been preparing for that.
