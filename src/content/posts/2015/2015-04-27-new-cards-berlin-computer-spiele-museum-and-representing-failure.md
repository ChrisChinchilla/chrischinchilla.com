Over the weekend thanks to [Berlin Games Week](https://www.gamesweekberlin.com/) I attended the <a href="https://www.computerspielemuseum.de/" target="_blank">Berlin Computer Spiele Museum</a> for free. It was a small exhibition but great research for Chip Shop and the visit combined with several other events during the week inspired me to work on some of the product cards on Sunday.

Interestingly this included working on cards for several products that were either failures or were never released commercially. I wondered how these should be represented in the game and opted for negative scores. There is a mechanic in the game that means players always have to draw new products, so it's unlikely that many of these products will ever be built, but they might.

New cards added include:<ul><li>[The Arcadia 2001](/card/product/arcadia-2001)</li><li>[The Entex Adventure Vision](/card/product/entex-adventure-vision)</li><li>[The Mattel Intellivision II](/card/product/mattel-intellivision-ii)</li><li>[The Magnavox Odyssey 3](/card/product/magnavox-odyssey-3)</li><li>[The Ultravision](/card/product/ultravision)</li><li>[The Atari Mindlink](/card/product/atari-mindlink)</li><li>[The Halcyon](/card/product/halcyon)</li><li>[The Vectrex](/card/product/vectrex)</li><li>[The Colecovision](/card/product/colecovision)</li><li>[The TI-99](/card/product/ti-99)</li></ul>
