Balls is the BFB's third release, and usually by the third album bands are starting to mellow, The BFB seem to be going completely in reverse getting rockier as they release more, not that their going to be donning Leathers and playing the Download festival any time soon. Balls is more direct than previous releases, the tracks are shorter, they kick in quicker and are more danceable. However fear not, the same Alt-country roots are still there, the same Jet black dark and arrogant lyrics still spit and curse their way through the album and the same brilliantly crafted song writing still oozes from the songs. I've been a fan of BFB for sometime now, but I've always been of the opinion that their live show is consistently so much better than their recorded output, and whilst Balls is a competent release, this still remains the case.
