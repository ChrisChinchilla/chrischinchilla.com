summary: >-
  The hoodie wearing kids are dancing and shouting, arms in the air as their
  self appointed spokesman for the night simultaneously castrates and celebrates
  the US pop and sub-pop cultures they embrace. The hecklers at the back are
  drowned out by his tight and hard rocking band and his witty hip-hop rhymes,
  we leave with a smile on our faces and sweat on our backs. In the words of the
  man himself, That's Fresh!
