summary: >-
  Betty Curse is one my guilty pleasure, I really shouldn't enjoy her music,
  she's obviously contrived, manufactured, she even admits it, maybe that's why
  I like her so much. There's something about the paint by numbers Glam-Pop-Rock
  that's just so damn appealing and fun. Something about the glammed up sense of
  pleasure, the ever so slightly silly and tongue in cheek lyrics so clearly
  written for Teenage Outsiders to sing along to. Maybe because it's not aimed
  at me and I can see the music for what it is that makes me like it so much,
  I've said it before and I'll say it again, in a few months Betty Curse will be
  everywhere, the kids will love her, the parents will hate her (well the dads
  will be intrigued) but they'll still have to chaperone.
