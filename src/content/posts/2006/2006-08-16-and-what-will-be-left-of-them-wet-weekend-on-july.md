I love Awwblot? They're an excellent live band and their last EP had some of the best dance floor fillers I've heard for a while. Which is why I don't understand this release. There's one recorded track, which isn't one of their best, and two live tracks, which aren't some of their best either. The lyrics are repetitive and the music doesn't show off their incredibly tight, catchy and cleverly arranged pop tunes at all. Don.t lose your way so early boys and girls...
