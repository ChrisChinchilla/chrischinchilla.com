Here are my old shoes...

They&#39;ve been everywhere with me, in four oceans, all over the world, on beaches, up mountains, traipsed through many cities...

but they had holes in, and after their trip into the Indian Ocean, they smelt...

So, they&#39;re gone :-(

But I have some nice new brown ones now :-)
