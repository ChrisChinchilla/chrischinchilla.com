She's had a strange life, and as would be expected has produced a strange album. Having worked with artists from diverse musical backgrounds from Country to Hip Hop and classical composers and a long term recovery from Illness has helped produce a dark and twisted but equally beautiful album. Sandy's voice is one of the strangest I've ever heard, it is almost childlike, the only comparison I can draw is to the female psychic investigator in Poltergeist(!), high pitched, but gravely and full of emotion. Some songs on Pull The Strings are a little self indulgent, but overall an incredible album for those up for something more challenging.
