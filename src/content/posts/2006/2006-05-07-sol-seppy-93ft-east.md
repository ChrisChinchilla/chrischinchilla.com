  Sol Seppy holds the stage like an entranced group of Children intrigued and
  delighted by their toys, their playmates and the noises they are making. The
  predominant lack of percussion in the intertwining melodies produces a
  cathartic dream like feeling, the crowed are invited and captivated, drawn
  into the bands' private world for half an hour, sharing the beautiful
  soundscapes produced. The band finish, the crowd cries for more, but we're
  back in the real world now and the night must carry on.
