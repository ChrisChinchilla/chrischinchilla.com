IV Thieves have been listening to too much Britpop, which isn't a bad thing, but last time I checked the Britpop revival hadn't arrived yet, so I'm not sure what the band are aiming for. Sounding like a big old mix up of the better and lesser known bands from the aforementioned era rolled into one, they produce a good mix of jangly guitar chords, appregiated breaks, a whining vocalist, and of course, tambourines.
