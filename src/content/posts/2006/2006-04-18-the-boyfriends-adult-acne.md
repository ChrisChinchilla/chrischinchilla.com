summary: >-
  The Boyfriends have never been know as the cheeriest of bands, and with their
  newly confirmed Morrissey support, they're not putting and end to that
  reputation. Adult Acne is in a similar vein to previous material, Martin
  Wallace's vocals floating above a wall of sometimes jangling, sometime
  crashing guitars, a slightly funkier than normal bass line and fairly
  unobtrusive drums. I couldn't quite catch all the lyrics, but I gather the
  songs probably about being ignored and overlooked, a good old slab of British
  gloom for spring.
