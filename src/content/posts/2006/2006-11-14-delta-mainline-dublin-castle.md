summary: >-
  A bubble machine is on stage pumping into the audience, a strobe flashing near
  the drum kit as the 7 members of Delta Mainline awkwardly squash onto the
  small stage in front of an already warmed up audience. The venue is too small
  for their big sound, occasionally hard to define and losing distinction when
  the whole band is in full swing. Delta Mainline create big epic slabs of
  noise, building multiple layers of melodies and noise and for the most part
  without becoming too self-indulgent. Vocally there's not a massive amount
  going on, enough to hold your interest and a few hooks here and there, but
  generally too soaked in reverb to pick much out which is probably for the best
  anyway.
