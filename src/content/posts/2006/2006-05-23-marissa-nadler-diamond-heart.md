summary: >-
  Marissa Nadler is an artist hard to judge on just two tracks. Marissa has an
  incredible voice, the sort of voice that could, with the right oppputunities
  and a lot of luck become a classic voice. Her range and emotion are
  incredible, sucking you right in to the beautiful melodies and this is why two
  tracks are not enough, I don't want it to end yet, I want more.<br><br><a
