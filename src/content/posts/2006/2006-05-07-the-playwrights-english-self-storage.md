summary: >-
  This is The Playwrights first proper release, plagued by bad luck and
  misfortune, it's been a long time coming and the sense of dissatisfaction and
  listlessness is evident. Songs like Why We've become invisible, Fear of open
  spaces, Dislocated and Where the stress falls are full of lyrics brimming with
  frustration of provincial and everyday living, the draw and darkness of big
  towns. The music is incredibly frantic, complementing the lyrics perfectly,
  the drums rattle about, somehow holding it all together despite never really
  settling into any constant beats, the bass pulsates and rumbles just as
  manically with the two guitarists crashing about, seemingly doing their own
  thing, producing wonderfully discordant melodies and rhythms that are chaotic,
  but work. It?∆í√ôs taken a while for them to get here, but this album is
  testament to the fact that it was well worth the effort.
