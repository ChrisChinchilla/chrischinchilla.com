summary: >-
  On the few dates I caught Kate live I found her absolutely enchanting and I
  can't even say exactly why. I think I'm a sucker for that sort of artist who
  quietly slinks onto a stage with no sort of presence whatsoever, an almost
  apologetic charm, and as soon as they start to sing the room stops to watch
  what is going on. Her voice is smooth but with rough overtones, most likely a
  natural talent with no training and whilst her guitar lines are simple and
  fairly similar across songs they compliment her voice brilliantly and
  succinctly. On album you lose the presence that comes from seeing her in the
  flesh, but you can still hear the strength of the song writing and the
  inherent beauty of her music. It won't suit everybody, it's very American
  (something that normally puts me off) in style, sound and lyrical content, but
  give a few tracks a listen and try to catch Kate live, then maybe you might
  see what I mean.
