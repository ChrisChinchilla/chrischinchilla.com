summary: >-
  I've never really been a fan or understood the appeal of Bright Eyes, so a
  collection of rarities and unreleased tracks was never something I was going
  to be taken with. I don't like his funny warbling voice or his lyrics, the
  music's alright, but nothing special, to be short, I don't get it. The tracks
  on this album are probably for hardcore fans only, some being poorly recorded,
  whilst others are not going to be his best material, otherwise they would
  heave been released already. For a completei-st, an essential addition to your
  collection, but for enquiring, aspiring converts, best avoided.
