3 skinny boys in black and a girl who resembles their teacher bash, screech and holler through a noisy bass led set. What a bass sound, (like an extreme Stranglers ?∆í√öBarracuda Bass?∆í√ô), blooping keyboards that occasionally emerge through the racket adding a perfect accompaniment to the chaos, bound by a tight but messy drummer and capped with inaudible vocals and guitar. It?∆í√ôs rough, they need another 6 months of rehearsals, but at the heart is genius waiting to be realised.
