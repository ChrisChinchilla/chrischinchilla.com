summary: >-
  The predominant problem for me (especially being a southerner) with jangly
  guitar bands singing with Northern accents, is that they all start to sound
  very similar, It's an unfair comment especially in You and the Atom Bomb's
  case. The two tracks on this single sound like different bands, which in my
  opinion, is a good thing. Track one is a fast-paced blistering riff led rant
  about and celebration of bad landlords and cheap rentals, track two a more
  laid back, melancholic affair about boy watching... I think. Overall,
  interesting, I'd like to hear more!
