summary: >-
  I try to avoid mentioning other artist's names as much as possible in reviews,
  but after just reviewing the new Bonnie Prince Billie album the similarity in
  style is so close I had to check I was listening to the right CD on several
  occasions. To be fair James Yorkston's voice is different and there's less of
  a country influence on his music, but melodically the songs are in the same
  melancholic, downbeat, lamenting vein played over a bed of gentle acoustic
  guitar and occasional accompaniment. There's more of a British feel to this
  album, especially on Woozy with Cider, a spoken word track that sums up
  British life and a musicians life beautifully, not that you would want an
  entire album of tracks like this, but it shows a more interesting side to
  James's work and the promise of more to come.
