summary: >-
  My first words on Camera were that they were a little too middle of the road
  for my tastes and that I looked forward to hearing more on any forthcoming
  albums. Sadly the album doesn't contain any more of the rock I was looking
  forward to but it is a pleasant enough album, and the first few tracks are
  uplifting and get the foot tapping, but slowly as the album progresses the
  songs tend to have the same feel and sound and disappear into the background,
  which is never a good thing. It needs a little more dynamic to keep the
  attention.
