summary: >-
  Chapter 24's intriguing mix of 60's beat combo, jazz and breakbeat drums is
  the perfect crazy emotional and musical rollercoaster soundtrack to a late
  Saturday afternoon. Bridging the gap between lethargically recovering from
  Friday's hangover to bracing yourself for doing it all over again. Raw and
  rough round the edges but with hearts and ideas in the right place.
