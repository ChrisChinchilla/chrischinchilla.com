Apparently this song has appeared all over some sort of Football programming... Having no interest in Football, I cannot verify this. However the title track of this single is another mellow, slightly childish bouncy offering from Jim Noir, his unique lyrical style again fully evident and his wonderfully repetitive but never dull melodies in full flow. Not as inspiring as his last single outing, but still an artist doing completely his own thing and making a damn good go of it.
