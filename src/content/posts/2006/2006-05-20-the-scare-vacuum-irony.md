There's quite a lot of this shouty, shouty, fast guitars, pseudo-disco drums stuff about at the moment. All a bit manic, songs structures that never really have any choruses or middle eights, just 3 minutes of loudness, there's probably some sort of ridiculously named sub genre, but I don't know what it is. The Scare have a fair pop at it, the singer's voice is quite often more mental than most of his peers, at times descending into odd screeches and wails, but the problem is the lack of dynamics, every song is mad and fast, it becomes a little tiring after 4 songs, perhaps it's something to appreciate more live with a big sweaty crowd who are equally mental.
