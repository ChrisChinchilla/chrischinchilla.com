summary: >-
  Every time Jeremy Warmsley releases something new his style seems to change,
  is he a creative genius full of thousands of ideas or just a little
  indecisive? I promise is a melancholic little ditty, gentle tip-tapping drums,
  acoustic guitars, plink-plonking melodies and wistful romantic lyrics. It wont
  set the world on fire but it could set a few romances alight.
