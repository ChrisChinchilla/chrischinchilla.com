summary: >-
  An odd choice for a single, quite slow, dark and fairly bitter lyrics, not
  exactly something to set the dance floors across the land alight. The B-side
  is in a similar vein both tracks are awash with brooding, building melodies,
  always restricted, always maintaining tension that never quite releases,
  haunting harmonies and waves of reverb soaked instruments adding to the
  melancholic majesty of it all.
