summary: >-
  Yee Gods, why are people still making, releasing or most crucially sending
  people like me such middle of the road Funk-Soul Ballads?! To be more
  constructive, it's well played, catchy and well structured songs, but sounds
  like late 70's pop music. Chiming vibraphones, a singer who's probably
  clicking his fingers whilst singing, string backings and falsetto middle
  eights. If you like this sort of thing then I'm sure it's great, but sadly the
  Beauty room are not my musical cup of tea at all.
