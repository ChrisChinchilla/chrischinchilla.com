New Rhodes have been floating around the peripherals of various music scenes for several years, always being associated with each one, but never quite part of any of them. Is the time right for them yet? This single isn't a marked change in direction or style for the band, the same melodious laid back jangly guitar rock, nice vocals, nice tunes, nice boys. It wont set the world alight, but New Rhodes till maintain their own little place in the UK music scene.
