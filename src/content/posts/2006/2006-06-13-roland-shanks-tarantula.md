  Sorry Roland Shanks, you've been around a while, maybe you were one of the
  first to do it, but if I hear another
  disco-beat-rumbling-bass-line-shouty-singer band, I'm going to scream very
  loudly. Maybe Roland Shanks have got more interesting songs, in fact the
  B-side even hints at that fact, and I know you're a bunch of down to earth
  guys, but don't just jump on the band wagon to try and get into the singles
  chart, or (possibly) to be more precise, don't let your label push you onto
  the band wagon.
