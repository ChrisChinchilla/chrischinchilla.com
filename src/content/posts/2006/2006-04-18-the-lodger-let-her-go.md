summary: >-
  The Angular Recording corporation built it's reputation on doing what it felt
  like doing, and putting out bands who had a similar attitude, so it's a shame
  that this single from The Lodger is a little generic. The a-side is pleasant
  enough, a catchy tune and quite danceable, the b-side, sweet with some nice
  harmonies, but it doesn't grab me. Though admittedly the more I listen to the
  single, the more I like it, a grower.
