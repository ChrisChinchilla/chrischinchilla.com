summary: >-
  I've been familiar with the Pipettes for quite a while, watching their
  fluctuating line-ups and increasing fortunes, this is one of their older songs
  and the first time I've heard their material in new slicker recording form.
  It's lost the Punky-Girl-Pop edge they used to posses but lyrically is still
  of the bitchy, biting ilk the Pipettes do so well. It's a short song, a few
  verses, and a few choruses and then over, a sweet slice of Pop one which poses
  the question I constantly ask with the Pipettes, what next?
