summary: >-
  If you are, or have ever been a jilted lover, pinning after an ex flame,
  frustrated by your situation and difficulty in moving on, then Join Dan
  Sartain. Currently undergoing similar feelings the album strikes a deep chord
  with me. Dan's wonderful twanging accent spits bitter, lamenting lyrics over a
  bed of reverb soaked electric guitar and minimal bass and drums. The albums
  got death, love, pain and suffering, a must for all melancholics everywhere,
  embrace your new leader.
