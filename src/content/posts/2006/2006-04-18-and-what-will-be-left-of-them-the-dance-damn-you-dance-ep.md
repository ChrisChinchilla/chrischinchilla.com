summary: >-
  Awwblot (for short) are an extremely competent and confident 5 piece from
  Worcester, who take the increasingly popular dual boy/girl vocals trick and
  fortunately aren't irritating. This 4 track EP has its ups and downs, the lead
  track, Dance, Damn you, dance is an anthem in the making showing off all the
  bands lyrical and musical talent in one convenient package. The problem with
  an outstanding track on a CD is that it makes the others, whilst perfectly
  fine in their own right, not seem so strong. Awwblot are a potential future
  hit band in the making, grab a copy of their early CD's before Paul Epworth
  gets his mitts on them and makes them all bloody disco.
