summary: >-
  You want to migrate data to a new Mac but are also interested in using a clean
  install instead of restoring from a backup to remove any of that unnecessary
  crud that gathers, especially when you someone like me who constantly installs
  and uninstalls applications and tools. I have been trialing a handful of tools
  and processes recently building towards helping with this and now I have a
  shiny new M1 Pro laptop it seemed a perfect time to see how useful they were.
  Here’s what I wanted to test and how the process went.
