summary: >-
  One of the most important capabilities of an observability platform is
  alerting. How quickly can you know when something is wrong, so you can rapidly
  triage and remediate that problem? Chronosphere recently released a new
  approach to defining alerts called “Monitors,” which gives users more
  flexibility with alerts and makes them easier to create and manage.
