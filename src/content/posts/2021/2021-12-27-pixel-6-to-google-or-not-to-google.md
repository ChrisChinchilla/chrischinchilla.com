I am one of those rare and crazy people that owned the one and only
[Essential phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/_essential_ph_1-8710.php). And I loved it. It was just the right
size for me, devoid of excessive branding, almost pure Android, and a
conversation starter as most people wondered what it was. But I am an
unashamed nerd and didn't like having a phone that was no longer
supported, and despite my best efforts, I couldn't get
[LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) to
work. I bought a [OnePlus Nord](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord-10289.php) and donated the Essential phone to my
partner, who gets most of my technical hand-me-downs.
