2021 was a difficult year for many. That's not to say that 2020 was any
better, but for some reason, perhaps due to the "naivety" of the whole
situation, it felt... "different". I certainly felt more prepared and
willing to face new challenges and to learn how to adapt.

Either way, I spent a long period of the 2020/2021 winter lockdowns
trying to be as supportive and as positive to those around me as
possible. I was active in online communities, helped friends and others
out, supported them through hard times. I organised online meetups for
some of the groups I was in, and when we slowly emerged back into
in-person events, I organised those too, and kept them going, keeping up
with constant changes in rules, requirements, and people's needs.
