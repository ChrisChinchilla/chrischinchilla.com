I was a happy, loyal, and paying
[Evernote](https://evernote.com/)customer for ten years. I loved the integrated toolchain it provided,
with the ability to draw, annotate, tag, OCR, and much, much more. It
did everything I needed in a note-taking application, and more besides,
such as basic task management and a dumping ground for miscellaneous
ideas.

And then came version 10. I have not made a secret of my dislike of
poorly implemented cross-platform applications that serve business
interests far more than customer interests, and Evernote 10 was a
perfect example of why I hold this opinion. It was bloated, slow, and
barely fit into any operating system paradigms. It lost features the old
(curiously titled version 7) app had, and worst of all, barely
accomplished its basic tasks of creating notes, without timing out or
crashing. Sadly, i kind of expect poorly implemented "desktop app"
experiences like this on macOS, but it was also terrible on Android and
iPadOS.
