summary: >-
  I have been using Parallels for a couple of years now, primarily for running
  Windows virtual machines (VMs), but occasionally Linux VMs too. I mostly use
  it for playing games, testing, and the occasional Windows-only application.
  There are some other long-standing options such as VirtualBox, QEMU, and
  VMWare. I am intentionally ignoring anything that also runs containers, such
  as Docker, as that’s a different use case, and a whole other gamut of options.

Recent changes in macOS suddenly bought a plethora new options and after trying VirtualBuddy already and reading a post from the ever insightful Eclectic Light Company, I decided to try them all out!
