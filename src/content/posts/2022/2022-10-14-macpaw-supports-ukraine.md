It's Cybersecurity awareness month every October and this year I thought I'd share something relevant from my recent trip to cover IT Arena in Lviv, Ukraine.

While I was there I bumped into some of the team from MacPaw a macOS and iOS software company based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

I have met MacPaw employees many times at conferences over the years, and even once visited their wonderful offices in Kyiv where I saw their famous Mac museum and met their equally famous office cats.

They are probably best known for CleanMyMac, Gemini, and Setapp. But since the beginning of Russiaâ€™s invasion, they also created a handful of small apps designed to help personal and digital security in a time of conflict.
