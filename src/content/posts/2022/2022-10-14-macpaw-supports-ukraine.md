It's Cybersecurity awareness month every October and this year I thought I'd share something relevant from my recent trip to cover IT Arena in Lviv, Ukraine.

While I was there I bumped into some of the team from MacPaw a macOS and iOS software company based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

I have met MacPaw employees many times at conferences over the years, and even once visited their wonderful offices in Kyiv where I saw their famous Mac museum and met their equally famous office cats.

They are probably best known for CleanMyMac, Gemini, and Setapp. But since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, they also created a handful of small apps designed to help personal and digital security in a time of conflict.
