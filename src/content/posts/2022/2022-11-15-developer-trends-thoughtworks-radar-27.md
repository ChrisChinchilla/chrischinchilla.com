Thoughtworks’ Technology Radar is a regular time to take a look at what experienced industry experts think might be the next wave of tools, practices, and technologies to consider or stop using.

I always look forward to adding many new “blips” to my list, or seeing which are growing in adoption since you last took a look.

Version 27 is out now, and it continues some trends that the radar has been following for a while, such as “platform as a service” or forms of group programming. This round-up is far from comprehensive, but just the blips that appealed to me or that, I thought, might appeal to you.
