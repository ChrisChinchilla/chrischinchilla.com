Many years ago, I took over a small publishing company, that's an
entirely different story, and not relevant now, but as part of it, I
acquired a Google Apps for business account. For years, I had access to
"business" Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Hangouts/Meet, and more. Slowly,
Google chipped away at what they gave you for free, which made perfect
sense, but I knew the time would come when I would need to move on.
[That time came this year (2022)](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217?hl=en-GB) and it was time to figure out what I
could replace these Google services with.
