Observability is fast changing from a practice that those close to engineering knew was useful, to a practice that everyone knows is useful for technical and business reasons.

A handful of posts from April highlighted this, and none more than a post from the pragmatic programmer by Gergely Orosz.The post digs into what happened to cause Atlassian’s recent week-long outage that hit their SLA promises hard, at over 15% below their target. I’m sure Atlassian has an observability solution, but as this newsletter has mentioned a few times before, if it doesn’t help you remediate issues, then is it worth having?
