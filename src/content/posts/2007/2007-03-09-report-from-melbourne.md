summary: >-
  Been a while, now seems a natural point to update you all on what I've been up
  to...<br><br>As now I have a home, and not only a home, but my first permanent
  address for nearly a year, which I was quite excited about, but now I also
  feel a little down as I have commitments again for the first time in nearly a
  year, it feels like the end of the Holiday.<br><br>This is compounded by the
  fact that I need a little more work, whilst the journo work I have is paying,
  and it covers rent and bills, it covers little else, I need some part time
  work, maybe 2 - 3 days a week, so I'm very paranoid about money...<br><br>All
  that sort of negative stuff aside, everything else has been going pretty well,
  things with 'Australian Lady' (don't know if they want to be named in my
  public outpourings to the world, yet...) have been strangely easy, all things
  considered.<br><br>I am enjoying Melbourne, it's a very vibrant city, full of
  life, variety, character, multiculturalism and culture. The size is still
  confusing me, one of the things getting me down about London was the
  nepotistic cliques I kept encountering, to be fair, they were nothing in
  comparison to here, everyone pretty much knows everyone else on the \Rock\"
  circuit, or knows someone who knows someone else (if that makes sense), the
  degrees of separation are slight, I'm unsure yet as to whether that's a good
  thing or not.<br><br>I'm attempting to cause a few crossovers of 'scenes',
  attending gigs and getting involved in quite a lot of social groups and
  alternative political activities.<br><br>Likewise, I don't know if the move
  was necessarily the best to further my musical career, whilst it may be easier
  to be noticed, breaking out of that may be harder, we shall see. On that note
  I have now started forming a new band and have some solo shows in the
  pipeline, people are interested in hearing and helping me which is
  refreshing.<br><br>After some technical hitches I have now nearly finished
  mixing the Macaca Mulatta demos, if anyone cares remains to be seen, but
  they're sounding good so far and that makes me happy.<br><br>So, I miss people
  and things, but now the story really starts... Watch this space, will be a
  little more regular from now on.<br><br>Chinch xx<br><br>PS... My (now)
  multinational promotions and label has an event coming up...<br><br>Here we
  go, PR is below<br><br>Antescene Present a night of :<br>Sick Country gypsy
  blues and perverts<br>The Cuban Bar, Camden on 28/03/07<br>Stables Market,
  Chalk Farm Road, NW1 8AH, 0207 424 0692<br>Featuring : The Urban Voodoo
  Machine, Captain Blood Blood & The Sea Dogs, Lil lost Lou,
  Congregation<br><br>Antescene promotes promising artists with something new to
  offer, artists who may not or donít want to belong to any particular genre or
  scene. From weird outsiders to promising ego maniacs, the decadent, the many
  and the few, all out there doing their own thing, making music for the sake of
  it, for the love of it. The event is in association with the ëNational
  Studentí newspaper, a free and independent newspaper for the UK student body,
  one of very few surviving in an increasingly commercial Student world
  (www.national-student.co.uk).<br><br>Antescene believe that music can help
  raise awareness of real world issues so the event will be helping promote
  Friendís of The Earthís ëBig Askí Campaign (www.thebigask.com), the campaign
  was launched to lobby for new Climate Change laws, Following huge public
  support, the majority of UK MPs supported the campaign, and the Government
  announced it would introduce a Climate Change Bill. The challenge for 2007 is
  to ensure that this Bill is strong enough, including annual targets for the
  reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions, and enforcing these targets so they are
  actually met. Meet with Friends of the Earth on the night, and find out how
  you can put pressure on your MP to ensure the UK takes a lead in addressing
  the greatest challenge of our times.<br><br>This is Antesceneís second event
  after a riotous squat party late in 2006 attended by hundreds of people with
  more events planned for the future as well as forthcoming releases. For March
  the 28th Antescene is promoting a night of bourbon soaked gypsy blues led by
  The Urban Voodoo Machine, a band becoming increasingly notorious for their
  bizarre audience - often including fire breathing dwarves and transvestites,
  as much as for their dark hypnotic and stomping rhythms played by an ever
  increasing number of band members. The Urban Voodoo Machine are suave and
  dress to impress, so get your glad rags on and bring enough money to buy some
  absinthe.
