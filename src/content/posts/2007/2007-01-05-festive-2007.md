  Well then, been a while since I last said something...<br /><br />Christmas
  was quiet, dull, so I guess that was a good Christmas, sat around a lot,
  watched telly, ate, argued with the family, typical stuff...<br /><br />Got
  back on the 28th and did a surreal gig with Jim, just the two of us, tried
  several new songs I'd written and then we did a few improvised songs together,
  it was most amusing and there was a fair audience to...<br /><br />We also had
  a great gig on the 30th at The Pop Art Birthday at Lark in the Park, you can
  see some great photos <a

  target="_blank">here</a> taken by Paul Maps... As you can see we now have a
  new guitarist, welcome 'Dan Lobster'. Jim and I also sat on a Questions panel
  and took part in Indie win lose or draw, all great fun.<br /><br />New Years
  eve was an odd one, sat about most of the day, dropped by on Chez Fruitbat to
  visit Les & Crissi and watch Time Team with them, then off to a party of a guy
  I used to work with which was pretty cool and I met his three foot Marijuana
  plant called 'Nicky'. Then Arran and Lydia turned up and convinced me to go to
  another party, where I never quite felt happy, so left about 2ish but it took
  ages to get home and I saw so much obnoxious behaviour it really depressed
  me... New years day was pleasant, took a very long walk from Aldgate to
  Tooting to meet Jim and a few others for Dinner...<br /><br />Then today I
  started working my way through the list of places I want to visit before I
  leave with my old Flatmate Carrie, though Westminster Abbey and St Pauls were
  stupidly expensive so we only ended up going to The London Museum instead and
  then a quick wander round the National Gallery...<br /><br />I recorded a new
  track over Christmas to, at the request of a guy in Australia who wanted to
  remix it, it's a live favourite called 'AAA', take a listen at <a
  href="https://www.chinchilla-music.co.uk/music.php"
  target="_blank">www.chinchilla-music.co.uk/music.php</a> where you can hear
  both remixes, or at <a href="https://www.myspace.com/chrischinchilla"
  target="_blank">www.myspace.com/chrischinchilla</a>.<br /><br />Overall though
  I've been feeling strange the past week, everything is in motion now for my
  return to Australia, booked the flight, visa is being processed and I can't
  wait to be there again, not least because I get to meet a lovely Lady again,
  but also because it has not taken me long at all to become fed up with London
  again, and be reminded of all the reasons behind this feeling, I'm just
  killing time at the moment, I can't wait until I can finally start something
  new and move on from a lot of past. I'm rambling slightly, it's hard to put
  some of the feelings I have on the subject into words without going into a lot
  of things from my past, I guess it basically boils down to "That was me then
  this is me now", I want to live a different life as a different sort of
  person, but when you're constantly surrounded by the trappings of old you, and
  some of those trappings refuse to give you a chance as the new you... If that
  makes any sense...<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I'm very excited, after a
  while of talking about it, I'm finally leaving the UK to pastures new...
