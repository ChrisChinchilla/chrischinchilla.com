summary: >-
  Any band who start their set with a ten minute under water puppet show earn
  Brownie points in my book. Also possessing a drummer who acts like a coiled
  spring the entire gig, sat staring intently on his drum stool watching
  everything on stage, exploding into fits of frantic drumming also earns points
  and I haven't even mentioned that NinetyNine write damn fine songs to. The set
  is schizophrenic with soft mellow soundscapes, loud raucous pop and even a
  track in Arabic. The songs are short, sparse and basic, simple but well
  complimenting melodies, haunting, alluring and completely captivating.
