summary: >-
  A folk hero belonging truly to the old school, Carus has chalked up an average
  of 200 shows annually over the past few years and still found the time to
  release several albums, 'Three Boxes√Æ being his third. It's mellow and laid
  back but brimming with passion, dedication and earnest emotion, the lyrics are
  tales of his experiences and life on the road, containing equal elements of
  regret and happiness with his lifestyle, the excitement and the loneliness. A
  beautiful album that can be listened to time and time again, it doesn't drag,
  it doesn't need to be turned off halfway through, it sits in the background
  and makes your workplace peaceful and it sits in the foreground and inspires,
  a perfect album.
