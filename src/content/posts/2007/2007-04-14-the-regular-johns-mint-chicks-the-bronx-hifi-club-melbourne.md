summary: >-
  The life of support acts to large touring artists is a tough one, playing
  early to half empty rooms for little money to people who are largely
  indifferent to your efforts and sadly tonight is no exception as a multitude
  of people seem happy to pay $30 to only watch one band. The Regular Johns kick
  off proceedings with a dangerous name for any rock band, as despite their high
  energy stage show, faultless playing and excellent stage presence, musically
  they are sadly no more than a fairly regular rock band. The Mint Chicks are up
  next, a band I've been wanting to see for a long time since they became a
  regular part of my DJ set in the UK and I hate to say, I was a little
  disappointed. Personally I get the feeling that the band's sound was set up
  for The Bronx as their usual clear punchy sound (on record) was just a big
  mushy mess with no clarity or distinction. Despite this, Kody, the band's
  singer is one the most acrobatic front men I've ever witnessed (second to the
  British Institution that is John Ottway!), flinging himself about left, right
  and centre, back flips and belly flops, sadly though the sound doesn't do the
  energy any justice and I'm left a little under whelmed. The Bronx on the other
  hand live up to all the hype my uber-fan companion gave them, my initial
  thought was that I'd be bored after 20 minutes of relentless, incessant
  hardcore, far from it, I was transfixed from start to finish. From the lead
  guitarist playing despite a shattered pelvis, the tank-like bass player and
  the shear passion and energy of singer Matt Caughthran as he crowd surfed
  around the venue whilst still 'singing' on full throttle and remaining vaguely
  in tune. Aside from the music the band love the crowd, flattering Melbourne
  and Australia, encoring with a cover of The Victims' song, 'Television
  Addict'. The Bronx rock, love what they do, love the crowd and the crowd love
  them, what more could you want?
