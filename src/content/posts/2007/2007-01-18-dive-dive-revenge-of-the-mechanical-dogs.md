summary: >-
  Despite a promising album name and some splendid song titles such as Let the
  Blind lead the Blind and Talentless Fuck this album on the whole pretty is
  terrible. There is too much Emo crap at the moment and far too much Disco beat
  nonsense (I keep saying this over and over again, I feel like I'm repeating
  myself far too much!) so why the hell combine the two! Commercial success I
  guess.
