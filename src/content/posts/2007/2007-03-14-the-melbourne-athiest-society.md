  I've just returned from Attending the Melbourne Atheists society (<a
  href="https://home.vicnet.net.au/~atheist"
  target="_blank">home.vicnet.net.au/~atheist</a>), I was intrigued to see what
  the topics of conversation might be, and tonight was the turn of agnosticism,
  hard work for the speaker, preaching to the (un)converted as it were. The
  first thing that struck me aside from the wonky OHPís and prevalence of socks
  and sandals, was the age of the audience; does Atheism hold the same appeal to
  the elderly as religion? Does the steadfast belief in Science and practicalism
  hold the same appeal as faith in the older echelons of society? <br><br>As far
  as I could ascertain from the talk being an agnostic is being open minded
  about supernatural entities and the superiority of Science, whereas Atheists
  discount supernatural entities altogether, although the lengthy discussion
  that ensued after the talk gave the impression that perhaps the definitions
  are not as clear cut as that, and as usual with these things a battle of
  semantics raged. It reminded me of a passage (as many things do) from
  Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy were the philosophers of a particular planet
  build a machine to tell them the answer to "Life, the universe and
  everything", when they get an unexpected answer it is made clear to them that
  they never really knew what the question was. If everyone has a differing
  opinion on what Atheism and Agnosticism mean then how can you have a balanced
  discussion on it? It's these sorts of arguments and discrepancies that have
  plagued the spiritual community for many years. If retaining an open mind on
  the origins of the world is Agnosticism, then I guess that's what I am, I
  wouldn't discount anyone's beliefs if I couldn't wholeheartedly disproved them
  myself. My final question is this, if we take Atheism as a negative, slightly
  pessimistic belief in nothing beyond the material world, and Agnosticism as a
  more optimistic, non-dismissive way of life, would Atheists still refuse to
  believe in a 'God' or a supernatural entity if it were proved without a shadow
  of a doubt by science that one existed?
