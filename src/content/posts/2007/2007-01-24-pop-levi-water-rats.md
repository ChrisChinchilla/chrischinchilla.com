10 minutes spent playing an E chord, ear splitting and ostentatious guitar solos and more posing than you care to shake a stick at are a few of the elements delighting a packed and buzzing Water Rats Tonight. Imagine part Led Zeppelin, part LSD from 'The Producers' (The original film) and part Menswe@r and you're half way to a rough idea of knowing what a night with Pop Levi is like.
