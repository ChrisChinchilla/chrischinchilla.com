title: 'Sir, Sly Hats, Guy Blackman - Northcote Social Club'

summary: >-
  It's a lazy Sunday afternoon after a seemingly long weekend as music fans
  slowly start to emerge in the fineries of summer, T-shirts, Thongs and a
  slight glow as the days get warmer and the nights get longer. No one wants to
  stand tonight, rather lounge around The Northcote Social Club's floor and Sir
  aren't going to force them to commit to anything as they ease out the weekend
  with their sullen blend of sordid sexiness, love laments and brooding ballads.
  Jesse Jackson, the bands' male vocalist gloriously underplays his role as
  'front man' and band leader, eyes rarely meeting the audience, his baritone
  voice wooing the crowd despite his tales of sadness and betrayal. Guest
  vocalist Jane Badler purrs through songs, her lips pouting, her eyes alluring,
  she posses that perfect 'Holywood' blend of glitzy glamour and restraint,
  giving you just enough to be lured into her trap, but no more. The band
  provides a near perfect bed of backing music to proceedings, creating and
  maintaining just the right moods for each song. Much like the subjects of
  several of their songs, the band leave to soon, the crowd wants them to spend
  more time, but it's not to be.Guy Blackman and Sly Hats have just returned
  from a two month world tour, and tonight is their homecoming show. The guys
  look tired so they've got a backing band together for the occasion and take it
  in turns to play each others material. The songs deal with subjects common to
  artists of this ilk with both artists sitting at opposite ends of the
  spectrum, Sly Hats leans to the side of romanticised and fantastic tales of
  life and Guy Blackman weaves narrative lyrics around tales from his life,
  moving into a new area, his Mum, things like that. The music is 'nice'; a
  horrible word to use, but it's the best description that will gain instant
  understanding. The tunes trip along in a happy-go-lucky manner, ending
  slightly prematurely, but never challenging or demanding too much from the
  audience. These two songwriters are almost brotherly in appearance and their
  songs share an equal degree of similarity, a fine pair of musicians who
  produce great music apart and even better results together.
