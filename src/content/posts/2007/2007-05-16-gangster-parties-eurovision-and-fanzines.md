After a surreal party on Saturday night... It had a Gangster theme, Gangster rap... All police tape, chalked murder scene markings, fake money and loud tracksuits.

Then on Sunday after a very long walk and a visit to the national gallery I toddled along to a bar to watch Eurovision. I didn't think Australians had such an interest and knowledge of European politics, which is basically what Eurovision has become. Where dozens of diplomats fail in bridging international boundaries and healing old wounds, cheesy pop musicians succeed. This year was very much the domain of the old Eastern block, and the old European countries like Germany, France, Spain and the UK hardly got a look in... And where was Italy?

Anyway, I've started digging beneath the surface of the Australian fanzine scene, here's my first post on the subject...
