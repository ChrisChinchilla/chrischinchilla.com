title: Jeff Strong - Jeff Strong
publishDate: 2007-08-14T17:41:08.000Z
summary: >-
  Jeff describe his music as 'City and Western√Æ which is the best description
  for the genre of Americana tinged mellow rock that Jeff Strong purveys, so I'm
  going to stick with it and probably borrow the phrase, if he doesn't mind. The
  album is home recorded with a lovely warm and familiar feel, which suits
  Jeff's, comforting and gentle voice down to the ground. Some tracks are pure
  Jeff, strumming his acoustic guitar, others feature additional
  instrumentation, and all ten tracks are calming influences on a crazy modern
  world.
