I suffered a uniquely Melbourne (and several other Cities) injury yesterday, I was cycling and my bike wheel got stuck in a tram line as I turned a corner, flipping me over the handle bars and into a (fortunately) grass verge, in rather comical stylings.

A few scrapes and the bike needs a little sort out, but I've jarred my right arm somewhat and it's very sore... It's amazing how much you use your right arm for (if you're right handed) that you never realise until it hurts every time you try and do something, playing guitar, brushing your teeth, eating, dressing...

I'm sure it well get better soon, but bloody sucks at the moment :-(
