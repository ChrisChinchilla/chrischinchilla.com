It's always hard to review one track single samplers, especially if you like what you hear and want to hear more! 'City Walls and Empires√Æ is a jaunty and radio friendly ditty, the 9 members of the band creating a complex interweaving of melodies and counter melodies, complete with a rousing unison of vocals in the chorus. Radio friendly, upbeat, a good tune, what more could you want from a single?
