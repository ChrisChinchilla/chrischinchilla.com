summary: >-
  Catching the last few songs of Mammal's impressive and powerful set, it's easy
  to see, hear and feel the appeal of Metal even if the music isn't quite to
  your taste. The brutal, almost primeval beats stir something inside, the raw
  guitars, screaming vocals and awesome stage presence forcing attention to the
  stage and the vision of (frequently hairy) men flinging themselves around a
  stage and motivating the audience with consistent and unlevelled passion,
  aggression and dedication. Metal audiences are also some of the most
  enthusiastic and excitable audiences out there, it takes very little to get
  them warmed up and keep them active for an entire set, no appealing to crowds
  to come down the front and to stop standing with their arms folded and tapping
  their feet tonight!<br>Hellyeah are loud, stacks of Marshall and Ampeg
  amplifier cabinets piled two high by three wide (despite only several being
  miked up, surely not for show?), Vinnie's excessive drum kit consists of a
  ridiculous amount of cymbals and of course two bass drums, there are wireless
  units in operation on all guitars and crowds of roadies and security are
  poised for this balls to the floor rock show. Bottles fly, beer spills, people
  surf, heads bang and everyone's having a great time, on and off stage,
  multiple tributes to Australia, Melbourne, the assembled masses, the crew and
  to Dimebag Darrell (formerly) of Pantera bond the band to the audience and
  Vinnie seems an especially popular man as every time he peeks out from behind
  his figure consuming drum kit, the crowd go wild.It's hard to figure out if
  Hellyeah are completely serious, and that's not supposed to imply that they're
  a joke, as they play hard, fast and competently. More that with song titles
  such as 'Goddamn√Æ and intersong banter about being guys on the road and about
  being 'in it' for the music they almost feel like a tribute show to Metal
  itself. The 'Supergroup√Æ line up and even the name, 'Hellyeah√Æ, don't
  exactly help to contradict that suspicion as the band work their way through
  an hour long set of rock clich√às that raise a smile but also raise the roof.
