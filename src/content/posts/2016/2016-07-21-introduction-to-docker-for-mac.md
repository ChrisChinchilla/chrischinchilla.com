  Recently out of private beta, Docker's new native applications aim to replace
  the current methods for running Docker on Windows and Mac, creating a better
  experience for developers using those platforms. For the previous solution,
  Docker Toolbox used VirtualBox to create a small Linux virtual machine that
  hosted your images and containers. It worked pretty well but could be
  unreliable at times and required workarounds that sometimes resulted in
  unexpected outcomes or not working at all.
