summary: >-
  Call me old-fashioned, but I have always preferred using a desktop app suited
  to each purpose. I feel that if all I'm going to use is a browser for
  everything I do, then why have a 'proper' computer? On a practical level, I
  travel frequently and am generally 'between' internet connectivity or using
  unstable internet connections, and 'real' applications are typically far
  better at allowing effective offline working.
