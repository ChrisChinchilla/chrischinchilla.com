I spent some time this week finishing off a lot of the changes from my last round of playtesting, most of these have resulted in changing Chip Shop from a somewhat random card game with a board (for no particular reason) into a more rounded actual board game.

This took a lot of time to balance the best way to represent concepts, undoing a lot of work I had undertaken and also keeping an eye on how this will affect production of the print on demand and boxed version of the game.

This has resulted in me shrinking the game cards, increasing the size of player boards and consolidating the main board into something usable and with a point.

I'm still finishing updates to the game cards, manual and build processes but will produce a full blog post covering all the changes and new elements soon.
