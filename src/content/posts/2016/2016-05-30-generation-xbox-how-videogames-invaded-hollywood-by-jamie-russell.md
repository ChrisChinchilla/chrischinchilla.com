I loved this book and couldn't stop reading it, which was a pain as I mostly read before going to sleep. The book takes an era by era look at how the video games and movie industries have tried to collaborate together, and largely failed.

The first few chapters were great research for my Chip Shop board game, covering such infamous tie-ins as ET, Indiana Jones, Tron, and a few you might have forgotten about. It was amazing how recent actual successful movie and game tie-ins were, with Tomb Raider really only being the first in 2001.

If you are a movie or video game fan, I strongly recommend getting hold of a copy of the book to learn about the trials and tribulations of two industries attemtping to understand and work together, but never quite managing to do so.
