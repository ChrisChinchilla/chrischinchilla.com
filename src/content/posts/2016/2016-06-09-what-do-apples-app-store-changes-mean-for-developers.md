summary: >-
  It's a sobering time to be a mobile developer, with both app and device sales
  down. Personally, I feel this is just the maturation of a new(ish) industry,
  and everything will work out eventually. But, noticing major dents in their
  revenue, the major players are clearly worried.

It's a sobering time to be a mobile developer, with both app and device sales down. Personally, I feel this is just the maturation of a new(ish) industry, and everything will work out eventually. But, noticing major dents in their revenue, the major players are clearly worried.
