Late last summer someone handed me a curious USB device that I popped in my bag and then sat on my shelf until today when I thought it was about time I plugged it into my computer to see what it did.

That device was the Blink(1), a fully open source USB powered indicator light that is highly programmable and customizable to suit just about any need you might have for a... USB powered indicator light.
