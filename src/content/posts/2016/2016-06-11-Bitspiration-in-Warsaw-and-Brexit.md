I'm leaving most of this post to the podcast version as I had a co-host
in the form of [Cate
Lawrence](https://medium.com/u/529dde579def){.markup--user
.markup--p-user data-href="https://medium.com/u/529dde579def"
anchor-type="2" user-id="529dde579def" action-value="529dde579def"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"} and we
spoke for nearly an hour about Bitspiration, startups in Eastern Europe,
Warsaw, WW2, IoT, Booth Babes, Europe vs Silicon Valley and much, much
more.
