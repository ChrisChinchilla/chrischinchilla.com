  Silicon Allee asked me if I would like to contribute some posts to their
  Medium publication and I thought what better to write than resurrect something
  I used to do back when I was living in Melbourne. I go to a lot of meetups. I
  enjoy meeting people, hearing what they're working on and being exposed to new
  ideas. Writing something about every talk I see each week would take a long
  time, so instead I will just tell you who I saw, what they spoke about and
  what you can do to find out more.
