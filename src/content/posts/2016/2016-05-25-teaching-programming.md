  Like many of my age and generation, I started learning to program with BASIC.
  These were the days when you bought magazines full of pages and pages of code
  for games or basic applications. You spent hours with your friends

  or the game didn’t work, and then giving up. It was more about hanging out
  with your friends, whilst your parents felt like you were learning something.
