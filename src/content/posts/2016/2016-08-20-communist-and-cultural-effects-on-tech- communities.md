  This is my second visit to Tirana for the OSCAL conference, an annual
  celebration of open source technology in Albania's capital. Aside from
  excellent content, the conference stands out for a couple of reasons. Most
  attendees and organizers are under 30, and the gender divide is pretty much an
  even split. Anyone who attends tech-related events in other countries know
  that this is (sadly) unusual, and I was interested in digging beneath the
  surface to find out more.
