A lot has happened in the past two weeks, a lot of it generated from
WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference.

On the surface (and the corny keynote didn't help) there didn't seem a
lot to interest developers, but dig a little and Apple opened and
introduced a surprising number of APIs to developers. Over the coming
weeks on SitePoint we will be covering many of them and how to use them
in your apps. As always, if you are keen to write, then please [get in
