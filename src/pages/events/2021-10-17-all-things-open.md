The discussions on what constitutes negative, biased, and diverse language continue in many open source communities, often sparking heated, and strongly-opinionated debate. But if you have decided what language you want to increase, decrease, or change in your community, how do you enforce and track those changes? In this presentation I look at how to use the open source language linter tool, Vale, to check text (in supported locations and formats) for rules and styles you define. I start with showing how to setup and configure the tool, and then how to use existing rule sets, or create your own. Finally I show how you can track progress during initial language overhauls, and how to track violations moving forward.
