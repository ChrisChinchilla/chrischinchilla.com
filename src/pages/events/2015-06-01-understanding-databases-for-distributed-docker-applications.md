In this talk we'll focus on the use of Crate alongside Weave in Docker containers, the technical challenges, best practices learned, and getting a simple web application running alongside it. You'll learn about the reasons why Crate.IO is building "yet another NoSQL database" and why it's unique and important when running containerized applications.
