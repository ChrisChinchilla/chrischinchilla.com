I have been a long-term freelancer and contractor in the past so attempting to
summarise my work experience and history into a CV is always challenging.

Below are chronologically the most recent and relevant projects I have
worked on, I can supply them on request.

My years of experience organising user groups, training days, and managing
small developer teams make me suitable for community, evangelist, training, or
writer roles.
