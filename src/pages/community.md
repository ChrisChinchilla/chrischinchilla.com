I am and have been involved in the following communities and volunteering efforts.

## Shut up and write© Berlin

_Lead organiser, 2020 to present_

Shut up and write© is a global community dedicated to letting people find the time to write.

There are dozens of global chapters and I run the Berlin chapter with several co-organisers.

The Berlin chapter has the largest membership base and meets the most regularly out of all the global chapters.

Myself and four others organised Berlin's first international roleplaying convention and tickets sold out in less than a week.

The open music school is part of give something back to berlin and holds multiple free music classes every week, largely aimed at refugees and those on low incomes.
