I have completed the iOS version of Answers Against Humanity, it is currently in the App Store submission process, but I am thinking it might be rejected due to the content.

In the meantime, if you have Xcode and developer knowledge, you can <a href="https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla/Answers-Against-Humanity" target="_blank">download the swift code here from Github</a>.

I found the iOS development harder than the Android version, which has traditionally not been the case. My main stumbling blocks were understanding Auto Layout and that parsing JSON in Swift is still  something of a challenge. Overall coding with Swift is enjoyable, but it's constant change means that tutorials are often missing or are inaccurate by the time you read them.
