My plan for 2015 was to spend another few months working on my various projects and then start looking for new full-time work opportunities. In the past month I made a few casual enquires to get an idea of what might be out there and ended up getting quite a few offers very quickly. Many of these I considered but weren&#39;t compelling or different enough (from past work roles) to be worth putting a hold on my own projects.

Then came an offer that was unexpected and was too good an opportunity to refuse. The kind of role that I have been looking to move into for some time. I am taking on the role of Developer Advocate for Austrian startup, <a href="https://crate.io" target="_blank">crate.io</a>. I will be working from their new Berlin office and it will be my job to focus on talking to and helping developers work with the product around Europe. I get to travel, talk cool tech and be fairly self-motivated, which is perfect for me. I will also have to move to Berlin, which isn&#39;t bad either.

This does mean that I will be a lot busier and have less time for the projects I have been working on, projects I still want to continue and finish. So my current priority before starting the job is simplifying and consolidating a lot of the tech side so I can focus on creating content instead of constantly tweaking tech. A lot of the initial decisions I made were so I could learn new languages and techniques for work skills. This is less of a necessity now and just getting on with things is more crucial. That&#39;s not to say that I wont produce some ideas using new languages and concepts, just not my main sites or non-technical projects.

So far I have merged the <a href="/writing/lean-traveller">Lean Traveller</a> site into my main Gregarious Mammal site as this is a topic I am likely to be writing a lot more about over the coming months. I am considering merging my <a href="/writing/chris-chinchilla">personal blog</a> to, but there are a couple of page elements in the site such as personal contact details and the &#39;hire me&#39; page that I&#39;m not sure will completely work merged.

Over the coming months I am going to focus on creating one chapter of &#39;<a href="https://onedaytheworldended.com/" target="_blank">One Day the World Ended</a>&#39; a month and at least a section (whatever that quite means) of <a href="https://chipshopgame.com" target="_blank">Chip Shop</a> a month. I am also creating pages for each project on how others can <a href="/get-involved">get involved</a>, at least then it means I may not have to undertake every task that is needed.
