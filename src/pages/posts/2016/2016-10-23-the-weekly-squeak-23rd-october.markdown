I've been travelling a lot the past couple of weeks from running a booth at the Essen Spiele Messe to conferences in Pristina. Cate and I will record a new podcast episode next week to discuss many of these, so in the meantime, this is just a links show folks.

## Links Of The Week

[Hacker fakes German minister's fingerprints using photos of her hands](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/30/hacker-fakes-german-ministers-fingerprints-using-photos-of-her-hands). I guess I was hopeful that fingerprint readers might start to replace outdated passwords, and this article was an unfortunate example of how easy it is to fake a part of the human anatomy.

[Who killed Cyanogen?](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/19/cyanogen_and_monopolies/). I have a OnePlusOne phone running Cyanogen Mod, so this news surprised and concerned me as I now wonder if I am running a dead operating system. It's a shame, as for a while it looked like Cyanogen and Microsoft were building an interesting viable alternative to Google Android.

In a similar vein, [Choppy waters: Jolla's titanic Sailfish OS voyage](https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/jolla-1329587) highlights the continued worries of Jolla and their ill-fated but fascinating (and I have played with it) mobile operating system.

We have been thinking about on-boarding processes at work, and if found this analysis of maybe one of the first modern on-boarding processes interesting. It feels slightly outdated, but groundbreaking at the time. [Why Windows 98's User Onboarding is Better Than Yours](https://usersnap.com/blog/windows-98-user-onboarding/)
