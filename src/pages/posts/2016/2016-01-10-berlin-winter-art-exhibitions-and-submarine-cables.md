Firstly, the beginning of this week was COLD. For a couple of days there was a low of around -11° and a high of maybe -5°. I know for some of you in more northern climbs this is nothing but having lived in London, where the weather is generally average most of the time and Melbourne where the coldest it gets to is about 0°, for me this was the coldest I have ever been.
