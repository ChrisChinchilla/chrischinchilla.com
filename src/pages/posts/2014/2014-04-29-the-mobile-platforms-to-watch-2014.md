With an average global combined market share of 85-95%, iOS and Android are by far the dominant players in the mobile operating system space. So why bother looking into or developing on any other platforms?

First, you might be an inquisitive person, and maybe are just interested in exploring new systems and concepts. Second, when has the tech space ever stayed still? The main players of today may not be the main players in six months time, and it pays to keep an eye on the underdogs and new entrants. After all, the market may change very suddenly. This is especially relevant as many emerging markets are becoming ripe for low end smart phone adoption -- and it's anyone's game in these new emergent and vast markets.

This is my first article as the SitePoint mobile editor, so what better way to kick things of than a tour through the mobile platforms you may not have considered yet? Expect further deep dives into these over the next few months.
