Before spending seven years in Melbourne and then moving to Germany, I lived and grew up in London. I am one of London's rarities, a real, born-and-bred, bona fide Londoner. In fact I am actually a Cockney -- and one of the last!

I decided to leave London and the UK eight years ago for several reasons. One of the main ones was that it felt like a dying city. Nothing seemed to be changing, it seemed to be stuck in a rut and living in the past. Until recently, it hadn't felt like this had changed in the UK, but in the past few years (I would say post-2012 Olympics) this has suddenly changed.
