I've been in Germany for a couple of months now and of course there the obvious signs you're not a local when you open your mouth.

Here are couple of other subtle ones I'm noticing:
<ul><li>I'm so used to putting my left foot down on the curbside when stopping on my bike I can't stop now I'm riding on the right. Hardly anyone else does that.</li><li>Germans wear their wedding rings on their right hands, we wear them on the left.</li></ul>

This list will update over time, keep checking back!
