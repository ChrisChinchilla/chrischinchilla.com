If you are, or have ever been a jilted lover, pinning after an ex flame, frustrated by your situation and difficulty in moving on, then Join Dan Sartain. Currently undergoing similar feelings the album strikes a deep chord with me. Dan's wonderful twanging accent spits bitter, lamenting lyrics over a bed of reverb soaked electric guitar and minimal bass and drums. The albums got death, love, pain and suffering, a must for all melancholics everywhere, embrace your new leader.
