This is good stuff, very rough, but very inventive and showing a lot of potential future promise. Songs that are self aware of the ridiculousness and trials and tribulations of the music business have always been a winner and this demo deals with this and other issues admirably, The Death of a band due to constant touring and lack of money, teen scenesters and troublesome girlfriends. Lyrical genius over a solid wall of music, it needs work but watch this space, as Billy Ruffian will be at the front of the ever-growing wave of anti-scene bands.
