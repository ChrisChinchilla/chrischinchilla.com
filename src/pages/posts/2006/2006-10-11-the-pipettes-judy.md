I've been familiar with the Pipettes for quite a while, watching their fluctuating line-ups and increasing fortunes, this is one of their older songs and the first time I've heard their material in new slicker recording form. It's lost the Punky-Girl-Pop edge they used to posses but lyrically is still of the bitchy, biting ilk the Pipettes do so well. It's a short song, a few verses, and a few choruses and then over, a sweet slice of Pop one which poses the question I constantly ask with the Pipettes, what next?
