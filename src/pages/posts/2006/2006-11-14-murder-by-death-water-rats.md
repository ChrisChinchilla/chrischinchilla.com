The front row is a mixed bag of hard rockers and country fans intently listening to the similar mix emitting from the stage. A constantly pulsating and alluring cellist, a rake-like singer who conjures an incredible voice from the depths of somewhere not pleasant, a pounding bass player built like a tank and the tallest drummer ever seen build a dark world around them, dragging the crowd in, willing or not.
