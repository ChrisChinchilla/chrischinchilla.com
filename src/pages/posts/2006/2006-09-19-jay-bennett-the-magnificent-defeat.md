Sounding equal parts new wave solo artists and post grunge acoustic artist (Think Nirvana's Unplugged in New York if that makes no sense) this is a riotous rollercoaster sort of an album. Some tracks big and wonderfully over produced with too many instruments crashing about and (unfortunately) Jay's voice incredibly badly EQ'd and swimming with effects whilst others are quiet, delicate and heartfelt, stripped down and bare. Thus the album is a little disjointed and schizophrenic, but also keeps the attention as you wonder what will be next.
