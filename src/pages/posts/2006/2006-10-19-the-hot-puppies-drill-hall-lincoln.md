The Drill Hall is more used to holding Jazz concerts, theatre and comedy performances, this is the first 'Indie' night to be held at the 600 capacity venue but the young crowd are more than making up for the small attendance, constantly dancing, singing along and shouting for more. The Hot Puppies also do an incredible job filling the hall with their grand sound, songs with big sweeping choruses, impassioned female led vocals (a crooner for the rock generation if you like), a pounding drummer and layers of synths and keyboards swooping and surging about. The band looks at home and comfortable on a big stage with the space to perform and show off, and why not.
