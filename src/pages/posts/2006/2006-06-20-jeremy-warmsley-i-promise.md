Every time Jeremy Warmsley releases something new his style seems to change, is he a creative genius full of thousands of ideas or just a little indecisive? I promise is a melancholic little ditty, gentle tip-tapping drums, acoustic guitars, plink-plonking melodies and wistful romantic lyrics. It wont set the world on fire but it could set a few romances alight.
