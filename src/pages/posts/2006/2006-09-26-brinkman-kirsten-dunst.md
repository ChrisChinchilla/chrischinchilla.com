I was expecting Brinkman to be heavier for some reason, maybe something to do with the name, the label, the song title, who knows why. The band is in fact a fairly laid back melodious three piece. The lead track a lamenting ode to the unrequited love of a Hollywood starlet a task the band manages to carry out without sounding like sordid stalkers. The B-side Harlesden is an equally harmonious ditty dedicated to life in one of London's less salubrious suburbs. I look forward to hearing more.
