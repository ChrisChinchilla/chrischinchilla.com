The Boyfriends have never been know as the cheeriest of bands, and with their newly confirmed Morrissey support, they're not putting and end to that reputation. Adult Acne is in a similar vein to previous material, Martin Wallace's vocals floating above a wall of sometimes jangling, sometime crashing guitars, a slightly funkier than normal bass line and fairly unobtrusive drums. I couldn't quite catch all the lyrics, but I gather the songs probably about being ignored and overlooked, a good old slab of British gloom for spring.
