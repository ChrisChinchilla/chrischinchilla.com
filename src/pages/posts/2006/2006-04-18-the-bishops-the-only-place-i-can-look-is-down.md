Whilst I raved about The Bishops for some time, I've always written them off as being fairly light hearted and their lyrics straightforward. After listening to their forthcoming single my opinion has changed, their lyrics may be simple but are extremely dark, it's a very misleading combination of upbeat music and downbeat lyrics. The Bishops sound and style is unmistakably 60's influenced, but with a very modern twist, I'm not entirely sure what that twist is, but it makes the sound theirs, the songs are short, to the point and pure slices of Pop.
