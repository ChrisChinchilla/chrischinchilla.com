A difficult album to review, it starts with a handful of beautifully crafted songs, resplendent in gentle guitar picking and breathy vocals. Then some rockier numbers with awesome jagged guitars, then it all gets a little dull and my attention is lost and distracted to other things. A great shame, it starts so well.
