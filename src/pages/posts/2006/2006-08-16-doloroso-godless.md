An odd choice for a single, quite slow, dark and fairly bitter lyrics, not exactly something to set the dance floors across the land alight. The B-side is in a similar vein both tracks are awash with brooding, building melodies, always restricted, always maintaining tension that never quite releases, haunting harmonies and waves of reverb soaked instruments adding to the melancholic majesty of it all.
