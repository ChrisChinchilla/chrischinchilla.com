Marissa Nadler is an artist hard to judge on just two tracks. Marissa has an incredible voice, the sort of voice that could, with the right oppputunities and a lot of luck become a classic voice. Her range and emotion are incredible, sucking you right in to the beautiful melodies and this is why two tracks are not enough, I don't want it to end yet, I want more.<br><br><a href='https://www.marissanadler.com' target='_blank'>www.marissanadler.com</a>
