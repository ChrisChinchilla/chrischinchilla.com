Bah, my heads all of a muddle at the moment, trying to write songs, but busy sorting all sorts out and can&#39;t quite get anything out, lots of bits and pieces of ideas...

In the meantime, take a look at <a href="https://blog.wired.com/tableofmalcontents/2006/12/israeli_army_ha.html" target="_blank">this</a>...

Working on loads of writing though, will put some links up to that soon.

And don&#39;t forget my Christmas drinks at The Green Man, Berwick st on 15/12/06 :-)
