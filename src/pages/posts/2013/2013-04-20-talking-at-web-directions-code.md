I am honoured, happy and excited to have been asked to speak at a Web Directions event, <a href="https://code13melb.webdirections.org/" target="_blank">Web Directions Code</a>, here in Melbourne on the 2nd and 3rd of May.

I am talking on how to debug and test your mobile web apps, somehow squeezing all I know into 15 minutes, it&#39;s going to be fun!
