2012 has been a big year, equal good and bad, extremely busy moments and dull moments to. I&#39;ve been to umpteen conferences, meetups and worked on about a dozen projects. Green renters stated the year really well, but dropped off massively after July, as did many other sustainability organisations and that was a hard hit for us.

Because it&#39;s been such an intense year, I&#39;ve learnt a lot about what is and isn&#39;t working for me mentally and physically, so for the first time in a while, I&#39;ve decided to make some new years resolutions.

Here they are...<ul><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">I&#39;m going to start to blogging again. I have too many things to say that aren&#39;t possible to encompass in social media updates.</li><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">I&#39;m going to ramp up my public speaking. For similar reasons to the above, but also because I enjoy it.</li><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">I&#39;m going to do more for me (and my wife). We&#39;ve both spent a lot of our own personal time, money and energy on philanthropic projects over the past couple of years and we&#39;re both exhausted. We&rsquo;re going to spend more time doing things we want and enjoying ourselves.</li><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Have more down time. For some reason, not being busy freaks me out, I intend to spend more time resting my brain and getting a few of those personal to dos ticked off.</li><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">I&#39;m going to try to be less uptight. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve said this in my life, but it&#39;s impacting on my physical and mental well being and I need to make a considered effort to change this.</li><li style="margin-left: 18pt;">Grab opportunities. This is a lesser one as I already do this reasonably well, but there have been some times in the past year when I really wish I have spent so much time worrying about things and gone for it.</li></ul>

That&#39;s it for now, let&#39;s see how I go...
