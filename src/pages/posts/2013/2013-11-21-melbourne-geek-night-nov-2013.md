It seems as the year draws to an end, we&#39;re having some of the best talks! Damn Christmas&hellip;

<strong>Web for TV, Sam Buckley</strong><br />Smart TV&#39;s don&#39;t do anything well. 33% of Australians have one only 5% browse the web on them, but a high amount for app type functionality.<br />Distance between viewer and device is an issue? Also interfaces are unattractive, lack of know how, not enough content, slow speed.<br />There&#39;s a lack of UX on TV(!) and the Internet is still a very text input reliant, with input devices still needing a lot of thought and work It&#39;s a lean back experience, with even more device sizing issues

<em>Should we worry about it?</em><ul><li>TV media type in media queries not even supported by most TV&#39;s Feature queries are the future path, or dirty user agent sniffing</li><li>Still... Be prepared for it. Design for large screens, distance and vertical scrolling vs wide screen, especially with a remote. Bear in mind performance and use simple navigation</li><li>Look at <a href="https://developers.google.com/tv/android/docs/gtv_android_patterns" target="_blank">Google TV design documents</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/tv/device-considerations/designing-for-tv/introduction" target="_blank">BBC</a> for more detail</li><li>Good examples apple TV, xbox 1, steam big picture</li><li>Prepare for new input devices -&nbsp; gesture, voice, biometrics</li></ul>

<strong>A dose of CSS animations and transitions! Jayden Seric</strong><br />Are animations relevant in a business sense, are they still a bit tacky?

<em>Tools to make creating animations an transitions really easy:</em><ul><li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a></li><li><a href="https://bourbon.io/" target="_blank">Bourbon</a></li><li><a href="https://daneden.me/animate/" target="_blank">animate.css</a></li></ul>

The difference between animations and transitions (filling in vs keyframes)

Two other nuggets that came out of the talk and made me feel really old in Tech terms&hellip; Flash is now considered old?! and the phrase&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s only a Google away&quot;.

<strong>Where&#39;s my jet pack, Nic Hodges</strong><br />A fascinating talk that&#39;s a little hard to summarise, so I might just whack in a bunch of links and points for thought&hellip;

The future we didn&#39;t imagine From a cultural perspective.<ul><li>Innovation doesn&#39;t come in big leaps, but small steps. This is ok.</li><li>We&#39;re not leaning into the future - creating a focus for innovation (space race, the year 2000)</li><li>Not much vision beyond now, determinate optimism</li><li>Were losing positive inefficiencies things that happened due to efficient restructuring, universities as an example, what&#39;s the real benefit.</li><li>Be aware of disruption</li><li>We&#39;re returning to a peer to peer culture from small to large and back again. Mobility and multiplicity</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson" target="_blank">Freeman dyson</a></li><li><a href="https://cir.ca/" target="_blank">circa</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken"  target="_blank">Howard Aiken</a></li><li><a href="https://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/forums/gutenberg_parenthesis.html"  target="_blank">Thomas pettitt</a></li><li><a href="https://www.rushkoff.com/"  target="_blank">Douglas rushkoff</a></li></ul>
