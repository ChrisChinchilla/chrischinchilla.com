I am excited to be the track chair for site building at DrupalSouth in Wellington next year and it&#39;s time to get your session proposals in!

Site building is the glue that pieces together a Drupal site and everyone has their favourite tools, tips and techniques for achieving requirements. I am also considering sessions around tools and techniques for content editors in this track and am up for hearing some wild ideas from new voices, so don&#39;t be afraid to submit a session idea no matter who you are or how new you may be to Drupal.

Here are some ideas to get you started&hellip;<ul><li>Best Practices. The tools and modules that allow you to best create and maintain your Drupal site.</li><li>Build Better. Building better Drupal sites with contributed modules and distributions.</li><li>Key Concepts. The foundations of Drupal site building and contributed modules.</li><li>Optimisation. How to improve the performance of your site from within Drupal&rsquo;s admin tools and contributed modules.</li><li>Sharing and Integration. Sharing content and integrating external data with your Drupal site.</li></ul>

Got an idea? Ready to submit, here&#39;s where you need to go - <a href="https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/speakers/conference-tracks#sb" target="_blank">drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/speakers/conference-tracks#sb</a>
