To those of us addicted to our smartphones, the myriad of applications we can install and what we can achieve (or time waste) with them is astounding.

But for those of us working in corporate or other industries that value business privacy and secrecy, the freedom that apps give us and that we give them, is a little too risky.

Apperian are one such company in the field, offering features such as app security, distribution, policies, logging and much more.

I sat down with Mark Lorion, President and General Manager at Apperian to discuss what the company offers and how they keep up with the constant demands and changes of their customers and mobile platform creators.
