## BigChainDB meetup

[Resonate](https://resonate.is/) are creating a cooperative streaming service based on Blockchain technology. The service gives instant transparency to tracks plays and payments. After 9 plays, listeners own the track, and for average users the monthly payments should be the same or less than Spotify and Apple Music.

Other Blockchain music services:

- [Ujo](https://ujomusic.com/).
- [Mycelia](https://myceliaformusic.org/).

[Coala IP](https://coala.global) is a working group, aiming to create a licensing framework for digital assets via the Blockchain. [This presentation](https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/slides/McConaghy-COALA_IP-short.pdf) is a good starting point to understand more.

## Questions for you

- Is it already too late for Blockchain?
- Have there been any worker co-op tech startups?
