Take a look at my latest [Indieoma.com Post](https://www.indieoma.com/public_journal.php?d=6da9003b743b65f4c0ccd295cc484e57).

Been another busy week, sorting this and that out, I've spent two days learning about all the new video technologies there are on the web whilst trying to get the first wave of Macaca Mulatta videos online. It took me a while to get up to date with new Codecs, sites and methods, one site that really helped was [Tube Mogul](https://www.tubemogul.com), it uploads video files for you to multiple sites. One other piece of advice is really experiment with compression before uploading, a lot of video sites are fussier than they might first appear.

I also saw [The Kaiser Chiefs](https://www.kaiserchiefs.co.uk) at Melbourne's horrible Festival Hall (Big echoing warehouse, with unfriendly staff and stupid rules). In two years since I last saw them the band have become an Arena band, all audience participation and massive light shows, who would have thought it...
