I think my main problem with this release is it's press release, it's almost as if it's describing the wrong band, I find it very hard to hear a lot of the supposed comparisons and descriptions. I know it's the job of a PR to ensure a band sounds good, but this one makes them sound like the best band on the planet. It's a fine album and Voxtrot are a perfectly competent Indie-Rock band, but fairly generic jangly American Indie, the clean type, very sharp, clear and precise, full of carefully constructed and catchy melodies and hooks, the sort that would sound ideal on American College radio, and prove very popular on it, but personally the album floats somewhat into the background after a few tracks, good but not groundbreaking.
