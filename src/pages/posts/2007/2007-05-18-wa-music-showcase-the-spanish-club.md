Western Australia has produced some of Australia's most talented and popular artists in recent times and it's not all Indie or Rock Riffage as tonight's WA showcase proved.

Opening the night were the bonkers 'Mink Mussel Creek' with their modern reinvention of prog-rock. Flutes, bagpipes, lengthy free-form rock outs, psychedelic influenced lyrics and attitude add to the bizarre spectacle and experience, oh, and a pixie-like singer who bounds around the stage with arms flailing and a T-shirt ten sizes too big for him is the icing on the cake.

Following swiftly were the schizophrenic sounds of 'Capital City', starting the set toying with Rock-a-Billy, ending up reminiscent of 'Primal Scream' and 'Jesus and the Mary Chain' via 'The Ramones'. Dark, aggressive and full of attitude, the band posses all the necessary ingredients for future greatness.

Finishing the night, 'The Kill Devil Hills' and their (award winning) blend of Australian Country got the crowd simultaneously dancing, singing and crying into their beers with wild acoustic guitar led tunes, dark brooding lyrics of vengeance, hatred and forlorn. Conjuring images of hot sweaty nights in the Western Australian Outback with escape from hot sweaty days of struggle found at the bottom of a bottle or the end of a fist.
