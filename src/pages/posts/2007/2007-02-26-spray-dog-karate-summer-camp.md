I wanted to review this fifth album from the Newcastle Lo-Fi stars as they reminded me of my fanzine writing days in the late 90's. Therein lies the problem, despite claiming to have influenced the current crop of highly successful bands from the North East of England (which I can't hear myself), the band remind me a little too much of the late 90's, they haven't really changed. If you're after a proficient slab of good old-fashioned Lo-Fi Indie then look no further, Spraydog are definitely the band for you, but personally I overdosed on it a long time ago.<br><br><a href=https://www.spraydog.co.uk target=_blank>www.spraydog.co.uk</a>
