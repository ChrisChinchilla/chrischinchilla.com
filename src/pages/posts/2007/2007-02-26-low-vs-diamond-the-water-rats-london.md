Why are so many recent bands from America so gangly? And why do they all seem to wear the same T-shirt's and shoes? And why do the drummers always have masses of curly hair? Anyway, after conjuring up images of generic American bands, Low vs. Diamond's sound is far from generic. A strangely enigmatic singer despite his odd dancing and slightly comedic sunglasses, big sweeping keyboards and guitars and a bass player who some how manages to stay in time whilst waving his bass about all over the place. The sound is a hard one to describe, melodious rock, nothing too full on, pleasant but not dull, engaging but not exhilarating, epic without being ostentatious, just good music.
