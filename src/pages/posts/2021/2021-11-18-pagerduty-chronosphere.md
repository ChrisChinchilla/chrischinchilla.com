One of the most important capabilities of an observability platform is alerting. How quickly can you know when something is wrong, so you can rapidly triage and remediate that problem? Chronosphere recently released a new approach to defining alerts called “Monitors,” which gives users more flexibility with alerts and makes them easier to create and manage.
An alert is only useful if it’s seen quickly and by the right on-call team, and that’s where PagerDuty comes in. Many of our customers use Chronosphere and PagerDuty together to.
