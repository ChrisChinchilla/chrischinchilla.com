Software development practices change fast. Development teams use an endless stream of new tools, frameworks, and practices, and it’s your job as a test engineer to make sure that no matter what your development teams use or create, everything runs and works reliably.

How do you keep up to date with what’s relevant to your role and with what the developers around you are using that might affect your role? There are lots of articles out there, but sometimes a good podcast can't be beat. You can listen to them on demand as you commute, work, exercise, clean, and so on. Even better, you can speed them up, slow them down, fast forward to the parts most relevant to you, and refer to the show notes for more details.

But where do you start? Here are some of the most interesting and useful shows and some specific episodes, some recommended by hosts and professionals themselves, and others reflecting my own favorites. Happy listening.
