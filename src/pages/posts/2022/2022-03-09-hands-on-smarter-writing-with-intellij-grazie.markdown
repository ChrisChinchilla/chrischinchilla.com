Yes… I know I pronounce the name wrong 🤦‍♂️ And yes… I know I am using the wrong plugin until about 12 minutes in, but I think it still works 🤞 😅. Grazie provides intelligent grammar checks, completion, and writing assistance for natural language text in IntelliJ-based IDEs. It checks text in code comments, commit messages, and text files, such as Markdown, XML, AsciiDoc, and so on. Will it convince me to switch from my customised setup in Visual Studio Code? Join me and see!
