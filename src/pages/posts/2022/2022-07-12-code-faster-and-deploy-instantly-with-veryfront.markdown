Veryfront is a tool that empowers developers and teams to quickly build and deploy web apps right in the browser. With integration options aplenty, is this a low code option you've been waiting for? It's early stages for the product, but some interesting ideas and features, that with more development could be a useful collaborative development platform for UI-based projects.
