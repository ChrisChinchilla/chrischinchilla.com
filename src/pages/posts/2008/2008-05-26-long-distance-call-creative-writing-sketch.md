_Phone on table, centre stage. Phone rings._

X : <i>(Enters from Stage L, Answers phone)</i> Hello?<br />Y : Hello.

X : Who's this?

Y : Oh yes, sorry, God here. How are you?

X : Fine thanks.

Y : Good. Is life alright?

X : Yeah, no complaints.

Y : No faults or problems, or complaints?

X : No, not really, none that I can think of.

Y : Good, marvellous. Ok, goodbye then.

X : Bye.

<i>Phone down, X leaves the stage at Stage L.</i>
