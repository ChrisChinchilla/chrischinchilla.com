# Green Renters
In 2007 Chris Ward and Cate Lawrence started a blog for people living in rental accommodation interested in sustainable living.

This quickly grew to a not for profit which provided information and resources for people living in rental accommodation on how to live sustainably as a renter.

The work included:

- workshops and public forums
- stalls at public events
- social media
- surveys of renters
- events such as expos
- extensive project work
- campaigns and representation of issues relevant to renters.

As the organisation is currently in hiatus, we transferred the website as a series of markdown files to [a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/GregariousMammal/Green-Renters) to serve as a source of information for those interested in sustainable living, renters rights, running a charity, running events, community outreach and many other topics.

You can find far more information in the repository alongside other resource links such as the organisation's image library.
