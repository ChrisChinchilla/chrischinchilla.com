I am a technical communicator with a love of explaining technical concepts in documentation, blog posts, videos, books and more. 

I currently work for Chronosphere and have a small technical writing agency.

I am a podcaster, video maker, writer of interactive fiction, and games. This website is a home for all my blog posts, podcasts, newsletters and creative projects.
