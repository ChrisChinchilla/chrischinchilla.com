I am a technical communicator with a love of explaining technical concepts in documentation, blog posts, videos, books and more. I run a small agency called [Gregarious Mammal](https://gregariousmammal.com) if you're interested in hiring me for that kind of thing.

I am also a podcaster, video maker, writer of interactive fiction, and games. This website is a home for all my blog posts, podcasts, newsletters and creative projects.
