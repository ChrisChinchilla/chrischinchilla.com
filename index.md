I am technical communicator with a love of explaining technical concepts in documentation, blog posts, videos, books and more. I run a small agency called Gregarious Mammal if you're interested in hiring me for that kind of things.

This website is a home for all my blog posts, podcasts, and creative projects.

It's also new and very much in development, so watch this space. ðŸ‘€
