title: Chip Shop

I had an idea for a board game where the players run computer companies in the 1980s. I took the prototype to two gaming conventions and playtested the game. I then got overwhelmed with feedback and the game is still on hiatus while I gain experience in creating simpler games. Chip Shop will return!
