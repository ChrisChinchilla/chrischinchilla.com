In my spare time I work on roleplay game supplements, interactive fiction, card games and board games. I have a lot of small projects in progress, not all of which are ready for public consumption yet.

## Expedition roleplaying card game quests

I have so far created two quests for the [Expedition roleplaying card game](https://expeditiongame.com) as part of [their regular writing competitions](https://expeditiongame.com/writing-contests).

-   [The Dead of Winter](https://app.expeditiongame.com/#1zVbhCh8byT7GP0c3vW0c3dHn7n-YDxSb)
-   [A Matter of Business](https://app.expeditiongame.com/#1j94feqcgTE841zpLzdbYJybWWQrMFMZx)

## One Day the World Ended

This is an expanding universe I am using for short fiction, interactive fiction, a roleplay game, and a card game.

-   Find the Roleplay game on [itch.io](https://chrischinchilla.itch.io/one-day-the-world-ended) and [it's own website](https://onedaytheworldended.com/).
-   Short stories exist, but they need a new home, watch this space

## Chip Shop

I had an idea for a board game where the players run computer companies in the 1980s. I took the prototype to two gaming conventions and playtested the game. I then got overwhelmed with feedback and the game is still on hiatus while I gain experience in creating simpler games. Chip Shop will return!
